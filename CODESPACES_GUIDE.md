# GitHub Codespaces Guide

## Should I Use a Separate Branch?

**Short answer: No, use your main branch** ‚úÖ

### Why Main Branch is Fine:

1. **Codespaces is just a development environment** - It doesn't change your code
2. **No commits are made automatically** - You control what gets saved
3. **Multiple people can use Codespaces** - Each gets their own isolated environment
4. **Changes are temporary** - Until you commit and push

### When to Use a Separate Branch:

Only create a separate branch if you're:
- üîß Experimenting with major changes
- üë• Working on a new feature
- üß™ Testing something risky
- üìù Following your team's git workflow

## Quick Start with Codespaces

### 1. Launch Codespace (Main Branch)
```
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click green "Code" button
3. Select "Codespaces" tab
4. Click "Create codespace on main"
```

### 2. Start the App
In the Codespace terminal:
```bash
# Install dependencies (only needed first time)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py
```

### 3. Access Your App
- Codespaces will show a popup: "Your application running on port 8080 is available"
- Click "Open in Browser"
- Your app is now running!

### 4. Make Changes (Optional)
If you want to experiment:
```bash
# Create a new branch IN Codespaces
git checkout -b experiment-branch

# Make your changes
# Edit files as needed

# If you like the changes, commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Experimental changes from Codespaces"
git push origin experiment-branch
```

### 5. Stop Codespace
- Click "Codespaces" in bottom-left corner
- Select "Stop Current Codespace"
- It auto-saves your work for next time

## Codespaces Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use main branch for normal development
- Let Codespaces auto-save your environment
- Use it for quick testing and demos
- Share the forwarded URL for live demos

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Don't commit test files or experiments unless needed
- Don't worry about "messing up" - it's isolated
- Don't keep it running when not using (uses free hours)

## Port Forwarding

Codespaces automatically forwards ports. Your app will be available at:
- **Private URL**: Only you can access (default)
- **Public URL**: Click globe icon to make public (for sharing demos)

To share with others:
1. Click "PORTS" tab in terminal
2. Right-click on port 8080
3. Select "Port Visibility" ‚Üí "Public"
4. Copy the URL to share

## Configuration File (Optional)

To optimize Codespaces, create `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Markdown to DOCX Converter",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.11",
  "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt",
  "forwardPorts": [8080],
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-python.vscode-pylance"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This will:
- Auto-install dependencies
- Forward port 8080 automatically
- Install helpful VS Code extensions

## Free Tier Limits

GitHub Free includes:
- 120 core hours/month
- 15 GB storage/month
- Sufficient for development and demos

To conserve hours:
- Stop Codespace when done
- Use timeouts (Settings ‚Üí Codespaces ‚Üí Default idle timeout)
- Delete old Codespaces you're not using

## Summary

**For your use case:**
1. ‚úÖ Use main branch in Codespaces
2. ‚úÖ Perfect for testing and demos
3. ‚úÖ No risk to your repository
4. ‚úÖ Great for showing your project to others

No separate branch needed unless you're doing experimental development!
