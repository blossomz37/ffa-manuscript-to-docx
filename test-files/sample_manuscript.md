# CHAPTER 1

"Tell me about the worst comment you've ever gotten online." My voice is steady behind the camera, but Maya flinches as if I've suggested she walk into traffic.

We're sitting in her bedroom, surrounded by the digital art prints she's created but never posted publicly—vibrant, surreal portraits that swirl with color and emotion. The afternoon sun filters through her blinds, casting bars of light across her face as she shifts on the edge of her bed.

"You sure you want to use this?" Maya tugs at a loose thread on her sleeve. "I could talk about something else. Like the algorithm stuff we researched."

I keep the camera steady, focused on her hands. "The algorithm works because it pushes things that get the strongest reactions. I need to show what those reactions do to real people."

Maya takes a deep breath, and I zoom out slightly to capture her whole face. This is the heart of my documentary—not the technical jargon about content moderation or engagement metrics, but the human cost of a system designed to amplify the loudest voices.

"Someone told me I should kill myself because my art was a waste of internet space." She delivers the line flatly, as if reading a weather report. "It was on that digital painting I showed you—the one of the girl dissolving into birds? I spent weeks on it."

Through the viewfinder, I watch her eyes dart down, then up—a visual expression of shame I've learned to recognize. My finger hovers over the record button, wondering if I should stop, if this is too much. But Maya keeps talking.

"The worst part wasn't even the comment. It was how fast it got likes. Twenty-seven people agreed before I deleted everything." She attempts a smile that doesn't reach her eyes. "So that's twenty-eight people who think the world would be better without my art in it."

I lower the camera slightly. "Those twenty-eight people are wrong."

It's the documentarian's cardinal sin—inserting myself into the footage—but Maya is my best friend before she's my subject. Some boundaries matter more than perfect footage.

Her smile shifts into something more genuine. "Thanks, Case." 

I angle the camera back up, refocusing. "Did you ever post art again after that?"

"No." Maya tugs at her sleeve again. "I mean, what's the point? The stuff that gets attention is either perfect or perfectly awful. There's no room for just... trying things."

This is exactly what my documentary needs—the raw truth about who gets to be heard and who gets silenced. I zoom in on Maya's hands as she absently traces the outline of a bird on her bedspread.

"Do you think you ever will?" I ask, keeping my voice neutral despite already knowing the answer.

"Maybe someday." She looks directly at the camera now, her eyes clear. "When I figure out how to make something that matters enough to be worth the comments."

The moment stretches between us, heavy with shared understanding. I capture ten more seconds of her sitting in contemplative silence, then stop recording.

"That was perfect," I say, lowering the camera. "Seriously, Maya. That's exactly what this film needs."

She flops back on her bed with a dramatic sigh. "Glad my digital trauma is useful for your college application."

"It's not just for—"

"I'm kidding." She props herself up on her elbows. "I know what you're trying to do. And I trust you with my tragic backstory." 

I start packing up my equipment, tucking my camera into its worn case with the careful precision my mom calls "camera OCD." Maya watches me, head tilted.

"You know what's weird?" she says. "I talk to you on camera more honestly than I talk to anyone in real life."

"Maybe because the camera makes it not real life," I suggest, zipping the bag closed. "Like you're talking to a future version of someone who might understand, not the people who are judging you right now."

"Deep, Morales." Maya throws a small pillow at me, breaking the seriousness. "So when do I get to see the rough cut?"

"Soon. I need to finish the interview with Jordan Seo first. And if Ms. Santos approves my budget request, I might be able to get a few shots of the Solas campus."

"The forbidden temple of tech gods." Maya wiggles her fingers mysteriously. "Your mom could sneak you in."

"And risk her job? No thanks." My mom has worked in food service at the Solas tech campus for three years. One breach of security protocol and she'd be replaced faster than a trending hashtag fades.

I stand, slinging my camera bag over my shoulder. "I should go. Got to log this footage before my brain forgets all my brilliant ideas."

"You mean before you start second-guessing everything and convincing yourself it's all terrible?"

"That's an essential part of my creative process."

Maya snorts. "Text me later?"

"Always." 

I pause at her bedroom door, looking back. Maya has already picked up her tablet and stylus, returning to the digital art she creates but never shares. The thought pinches something in my chest—all that talent, all those vibrant visions, hidden away because twenty-eight strangers decided her voice wasn't worth hearing.

This is why my documentary matters. This is what I need to show.

---

The News Lab at North Point High is chaos in a confined space. Desks cluttered with outdated equipment, walls plastered with journalism awards from the pre-social media era, and Ms. Santos's collection of newspaper front pages documenting everything from Watergate to the Arab Spring. It smells like old coffee and printer toner, and it's the only place at school where I feel completely at home.

"Casey! Perfect timing." Ms. Santos waves me over to her desk where she's hunched over her laptop. "Come look at this."

I weave through the obstacle course of backpacks and camera tripods. Two sophomore staff writers are arguing about headline phrasing for next week's paper, and a junior is editing video for the school's YouTube channel. Nobody looks up when I pass. In here, everyone is too focused on their own projects to worry about social hierarchy.

Ms. Santos points at her screen. "This just crossed my feed. Content warning for rage-inducing corporate nonsense."

It's a press release from InstaFrame announcing new "creator monetization tools." I scan the PR-speak quickly, my stomach sinking with each paragraph.

"So they're restricting paid content to creators with at least fifty thousand followers?" I translate.

"And a 'consistent engagement pattern,'" Ms. Santos adds, making air quotes. "Whatever that means."

"It means they only want to pay people who already have a platform." I drop into the chair next to her desk. "The whole system is rigged for people who are already winning."

Ms. Santos nods, her dark curls bouncing slightly. "Sounds like a perfect addition to your documentary."

Ms. Santos is the only teacher at North Point who treats my documentary as more than a hobby or college application padding. She gets what I'm trying to do—expose the invisible barriers that determine whose stories get amplified and whose get buried.

"How's it coming along?" she asks, closing the press release. "Still on track for the spring showcase?"

"If I can finish all my interviews." I pull out my notebook, flipping to my production schedule. "I got great stuff from Maya today. Raw, honest. Exactly what I needed."

"She trusts you," Ms. Santos says. "That matters more than fancy equipment or perfect lighting."

"Speaking of equipment..." I give her my most hopeful look. "Any word on that budget request for external mics?"

She laughs. "Still working on it. The athletic department got a new digital scoreboard, but apparently boom mics are a luxury we can't afford."

"Priorities," I mutter.

"Speaking of priorities," Ms. Santos lowers her voice, "Avery Liang is going to be here in about five minutes for her independent study check-in. If you want to avoid the Avery Show, now's your chance to escape."

My mood deflates at the mention of Avery's name. "Thanks for the warning."

"I know she's not your favorite person, but she is going to be in here twice a week this semester. Might be worth finding a way to coexist peacefully."

I make a noncommittal noise. Avery Liang is everything I'm critiquing in my documentary—a perfectly curated online presence, monetized and optimized for maximum engagement. As North Point's resident influencer, with her 200,000 followers across platforms, she's turned being watched into a career.

"What's her independent study even about?" I ask, packing up my notes. "The economics of hawking diet tea to teenage girls?"

Ms. Santos gives me a disapproving look. "Digital marketing and media literacy. And regardless of what you think about her content, she's smart and driven."

"Smart enough to know exactly what she's selling," I mutter.

The door to the News Lab swings open, and the energy in the room shifts immediately. Conversations pause, heads turn. Avery Liang has arrived.

She glides in wearing what looks like a casual outfit but is undoubtedly tagged and sponsored in her posts—slightly oversized sweater in a perfect shade of sage green, light-wash jeans, white sneakers that somehow have no scuff marks. Her dark hair falls in waves that seem simultaneously effortless and precision-engineered. 

"Ms. Santos!" Avery's voice carries the practiced enthusiasm of someone who knows they're always being watched. "I brought you a coffee. Oat milk latte, right?"

Ms. Santos accepts the cup with a smile. "Thank you, Avery. Very thoughtful."

Avery notices me and her smile shifts almost imperceptibly. "Casey! I didn't know you hung out in here."

There's a subtle emphasis on "hung out" that suggests what I do isn't serious work. I force a smile. "Just reviewing some footage."

"For your documentary?" Her interest seems genuine, which is somehow more irritating. "That's so cool. What's it about again?"

"Digital inequality." I keep my answer brief, wary of saying too much. "How algorithms and platform design determine which voices get amplified."

"Fascinating." Avery sets her designer tote bag on a desk. "You should consider making a TikTok series about it. Short-form content gets way more engagement than traditional documentaries. I could give you some tips on hashtag strategy."

The irony is so thick I could film it. "I'll keep that in mind."

"Avery, let's go over your project outline," Ms. Santos intervenes, sensing my discomfort. "Casey, are you heading out?"

"Yeah, I need to upload this footage." I shoulder my bag, eager to escape. "See you tomorrow, Ms. Santos."

Avery waves as I leave. "Good luck with your project!"

Her well-wishes feel like sandpaper against my skin. There's nothing malicious in her tone, but something about Avery has always set my teeth on edge. Maybe it's the way her entire existence seems designed for consumption, every gesture calculated for maximum likability.

Or maybe it's just that she makes it look so easy—being seen, being heard, being validated—while people like Maya hide their light away, wounded by the very platforms that catapult people like Avery to micro-fame.

---

The cafeteria at North Point is a living map of social territory. The circular tables near the windows belong to athletes and their orbiting admirers. The long tables against the back wall are for the theater kids and band members. The corner nook is reserved for the serious academic types and early-admission college hopefuls.

Maya and I sit at our usual spot—a small table partially hidden by a support column, offering a perfect vantage point to observe without being observed.

"Anything worth documenting today?" Maya asks, picking at her salad.

I scan the cafeteria through an invisible viewfinder, framing shots in my mind. "Same hierarchical rituals as always. Though there's an interesting dynamic happening at Avery's table."

Maya follows my gaze to where Avery sits holding court with her usual entourage. They're all looking at phones, showing each other screens, laughing at intervals that seem choreographed.

"What am I missing?" Maya asks.

"Watch how they take turns talking. It's like they're performing a conversation rather than having one."

Maya squints. "That's... actually kind of sad."

"It's content generation disguised as friendship," I say, opening my own lunch. "They're workshopping reactions in real-time before they post."

As if on cue, Avery stands up, positioning herself at a specific angle to the window light. One of her friends raises a phone, and Avery laughs on command—head tilted back, hand gracefully touching her collarbone. Three quick shots, then they huddle to review.

"That laugh wasn't even in response to anything," I observe. "Pure performance."

"You're doing your documentary narrator voice again," Maya says, smirking.

"Sorry." I bite into my sandwich, forcing myself to stop analyzing. "How was bio?"

"Boring. Mr. Chen spent twenty minutes explaining cellular respiration with sports metaphors." She pulls out her tablet. "But I did make this while he was talking."

She shows me a sketch—a stylized portrait of a girl whose face is partially obscured by a cascade of symbols: likes, shares, comments. Only her eyes are fully visible, looking directly at the viewer.

"Maya, this is incredible." I take the tablet for a closer look. "The composition, the symbolism—it's perfect."

She shrugs, but I catch the small smile my praise brings. "Just a doodle."

"This should be in a gallery, not hidden on your tablet." I hand it back to her. "Seriously. You should post this."

Her smile fades. "You know I don't do that anymore."

"I know, but—"

"Look, not everyone wants to broadcast their thoughts to the world. Some of us prefer to exist without an audience score."

I recognize the defensive edge in her voice and back off. "You're right. Sorry."

Maya sighs. "No, I'm sorry. I just... the thought of putting anything out there makes my stomach hurt."

Before I can respond, a ripple of activity sweeps through the cafeteria. Phones ding in sequence like digital dominoes falling. Maya's phone buzzes, and she glances at it.

"Avery just dropped a new post," she reports. "Something about sustainable fashion choices."

I roll my eyes. "Let me guess—linking to products she gets a commission on?"

"Probably." Maya scrolls through the post. "Though she does mention that fast fashion thing you were researching for your doc."

My head snaps up. "What?"

"Yeah, about how those cheap clothes end up in landfills in developing countries. She's advocating for 'conscious consumption' or whatever."

A cold feeling slides down my spine. I had compiled that research last week for the segment on environmental impact in marginalized communities. How did Avery suddenly develop an interest in the exact same topic?

"Can I see?" I reach for Maya's phone.

The post shows Avery in her perfect sage sweater, looking soulfully at the camera. The caption is a passionate plea about the "hidden costs of fast fashion" with statistics that sound eerily familiar.

"That's weird," I mutter.

"What?" 

"Nothing." I hand the phone back, not wanting to sound paranoid. "Just surprised Avery cares about something beyond engagement metrics."

Across the cafeteria, Avery's table erupts in celebration. Someone shows her a phone screen, and she claps her hands in excitement. Even from here, I can read her body language: victory, validation, success.

I try to shake off my unease. It's not like I have a monopoly on caring about environmental issues. Still, the timing feels strange.

The bell rings, signaling the end of lunch. Maya stands, gathering her things. "You coming to history?"

"Yeah." I pack up slowly, my eyes still on Avery's table. "Hey, did I ever tell you what my documentary is actually called?"

"Something pretentious and film-school bait?" Maya teases.

"Close. It's called 'The Signal.'" I shoulder my bag. "It's about finding your true voice through all the noise."

Maya considers this, then nods. "I like it. Mysterious but meaningful."

"That's me. Mysterious but meaningful."

She snorts. "You're about as mysterious as a glass house, Case. You literally document everything you think and feel."

"Not everything," I say, thinking of the things even my camera doesn't see—my fear that no one will care about my film, my worry that I'm wasting time on a project that will never matter.

Maya bumps my shoulder as we walk. "Your documentary is going to be amazing. People need to hear what you have to say."

"What we all have to say," I correct her. "That's the whole point."

As we leave the cafeteria, I glance back one last time. Avery is still at her table, alone now, staring intently at her phone. For a brief moment, with no audience watching, her face is blank, almost empty—a canvas waiting for the next performance.

Then she looks up, catches me watching, and instantly smiles. I turn away quickly, but not before seeing something calculated in her eyes, something that makes me hold my camera bag a little closer.

---

Later that evening, I sit cross-legged on my bed, reviewing the footage from Maya's interview. My small bedroom doubles as an editing suite, with my ancient laptop balanced on a stack of books and external hard drives clustered on my desk like electronic mushrooms.

Through my headphones, Maya's voice plays back: "Maybe someday. When I figure out how to make something that matters enough to be worth the comments."

I pause, making a note on my storyboard. This line perfectly captures the central question of my documentary: Who gets to decide what matters? Why are some voices amplified while others are silenced? How does the system itself—the algorithms, the platform design, the engagement metrics—shape whose stories are seen and valued?

A knock at my door interrupts my thoughts. My mom pokes her head in, still wearing her work uniform from the Solas campus cafeteria. Her hair is pulled back in a tight bun, and the faint lines around her eyes look deeper than they did this morning.

"Dinner in fifteen," she says. "Just reheating leftovers."

"Thanks, Mom." I pull off my headphones. "How was work?"

She shrugs, leaning against the doorframe. "The usual. Fed a bunch of tech geniuses who don't know I exist." Her eyes land on my laptop screen. "How's the movie coming?"

"Documentary," I correct automatically. "It's good. I got some great footage from Maya today."

My mom nods, but I can see the question in her eyes—the same one she's been asking in different ways since I started this project: What's the point?

"This is really important to you, isn't it?" she says finally.

"Yeah, it is." I close my laptop, giving her my full attention. "It's about something that matters."

"I know, honey." Her smile is tired but genuine. "I just worry about you putting so much time into something that—" She stops herself.

"That what?" I prompt.

"That might not have the outcome you're hoping for." She says it gently, but the words still sting. "I just don't want you to be disappointed."

What she means is: I don't want you to waste your time. What she means is: There are safer paths to focus on. What she means is: People like us don't get to change the world.

"I'm not expecting it to change everything," I say, trying to keep the defensiveness out of my voice. "But it might change something. For someone."

She studies me for a moment, then nods. "Okay. Fifteen minutes for dinner."

After she leaves, I reopen my laptop and stare at the frozen image of Maya. Her expression is open, vulnerable, honest—everything my documentary needs to be.

My mom doesn't understand that this isn't just about college applications or building a portfolio. It's about proving that stories like ours deserve to be told. That voices like Maya's matter. That the system that silences them needs to be exposed and challenged.

I press play again, and Maya continues: "When I figure out how to make something that matters enough to be worth the comments."

"Your voice already matters," I whisper to the screen. "And I'm going to make sure people hear it."

A warm certainty spreads through me—the feeling that despite my mom's concerns, despite the massive forces working against stories like mine, this documentary could actually make a difference. It's a delicate, hopeful feeling, as fragile as it is powerful.

I save my work and close my laptop, holding onto that hope as I head to dinner. Tomorrow I'll keep filming, keep documenting, keep fighting to amplify the signals that get lost in the noise.

# Chapter 2

# CHAPTER 2

The News Lab desktop computer wheezes when I try to render the latest segment of my documentary. The progress bar crawls across the screen, each percent an exercise in patience. This ancient machine wasn't designed for video editing, but it's what we've got.

"Come on," I mutter, tapping my fingers against the desk. "Just five more minutes of processing and I'll leave you alone."

The fluorescent lights hum overhead as afternoon sunshine slants through the dusty blinds. Most of the News Lab is empty now—school ended an hour ago, and even Ms. Santos has stepped out for a meeting. It's just me and the dying computer, locked in a battle of wills.

I pull out my production notebook while I wait, flipping to my storyboard. Maya's interview will anchor the middle section on self-censorship. I need to intercut it with statistics on content moderation, then transition to Jordan's segment on algorithmic bias, assuming he finally agrees to be interviewed.

The footage from Maya is gold—raw, honest, exactly what I need to make people understand what's at stake. Her voice deserves to be heard, even if she's afraid to use it herself.

A notification pops up on the screen: RENDER COMPLETE.

"Finally." I click to review the segment.

Maya's face fills the frame, her voice clear through my headphones: "Twenty-eight people who think the world would be better without my art in it." The pain in her eyes is unmistakable, even as she tries to sound casual.

A swell of protectiveness rises in my chest. This footage is more than just material for my documentary—it's Maya trusting me with her vulnerability. I'm responsible for making sure her story is told with respect.

I save the file to my external drive, then to the school's shared media server as a backup. The server is a dinosaur, slow and glitchy, but Ms. Santos insists we use it. "Redundancy is a journalist's best friend," she always says. "Save everywhere, always."

"Casey?" A voice breaks into my concentration.

I look up to see Ms. Liu, the calculus teacher, poking her head into the News Lab. "Sorry to interrupt, but do you have a minute? The printer in the math office is jammed again, and none of us can figure it out."

I suppress a sigh. Being one of the few tech-literate students comes with unofficial IT duties.

"Sure," I say, pulling off my headphones. "Give me one second."

I glance at my workstation. I should log out, but the render just finished, and I still need to transfer some files. It'll just take a minute to fix Ms. Liu's printer problem.

"I'll be right back," I tell the computer, as if it's listening. I follow Ms. Liu into the hallway.

---

Twenty minutes later, after extracting a mangled worksheet from the math department printer and explaining to three teachers how to adjust the paper settings, I return to the News Lab. The room is still empty, but something feels different. I pause in the doorway, scanning the space.

My workstation looks untouched. My notebook lies open on the desk, external drive beside it. The computer is still on, screen showing my editing software. Nothing seems out of place, but a prickle of unease crawls up my spine.

I shake it off. The News Lab always feels a little creepy when it's empty—too many screens glowing in the dim light, too many cameras pointed in random directions.

Settling back at my desk, I continue organizing my footage. I label everything meticulously: "Maya_Interview_Raw," "Maya_Interview_Edit_1," "B-Roll_School_Hallway." Organization is crucial when you're working with hours of material.

After finishing my backup, I shut down the computer and pack up my equipment. As I zip my bag closed, I notice a folded piece of paper on the floor near the door. I pick it up—a hall pass with Avery Liang's name on it, signed by Mr. Evans for 3:45 PM. About fifteen minutes after I left to help Ms. Liu.

Avery was here? Why? Her independent study meetings with Ms. Santos are Tuesdays and Thursdays. Today is Monday.

The unease returns, stronger now. I glance back at my workstation, wondering if she touched anything. But there's no way to tell, and I've already shut down the computer.

It's probably nothing. Avery probably dropped off something for Ms. Santos. The timing is just a coincidence.

Still, as I leave the News Lab, I can't shake the feeling that something isn't right.

---

At home, I spread my homework across the kitchen table, attempting to focus on calculus while my documentary footage uploads to my laptop. Mom won't be home for another hour—Monday is inventory day at Solas, which means a later shift.

My phone buzzes with a text from Maya.

**Maya**: Have you seen Avery's new post?

I frown at the screen. Why would Maya think I'd be monitoring Avery's social media?

**Me**: No. Why?

**Maya**: Just check InstaFrame. Now.

Something in her tone makes my stomach tighten. I open the app and navigate to Avery's profile. Her most recent post is from thirty minutes ago, already racking up thousands of likes. The caption reads:

"Starting a new series on hidden struggles & invisible barriers in our digital world. These stories need to be told. 🎬 #RealVoices #DigitalDivide #UntoldStories"

Beneath it is a video—a slickly edited clip with atmospheric music and a muted color grade. I tap to play it, and my blood turns to ice.

It's Maya. My footage of Maya. Her interview from my documentary, but chopped up, remixed, overlaid with somber piano music and pretentious text graphics that read "THE UNHEARD" and "DIGITAL TRAUMA."

Maya's raw vulnerability has been packaged into a perfect sixty-second tragedy for easy consumption. Her words about online harassment are intact, but stripped of context, reframed as a pitiful confession rather than the thoughtful reflection it was.

And worst of all—Avery's voiceover narrates over parts of it: "I've been documenting the hidden struggles of my generation..." As if she conducted the interview. As if she created this footage. As if Maya's story belongs to her.

My hands shake so badly I nearly drop my phone. The view count is already at 47,000 and climbing. The comments section is flooded with praise:

"So brave of you to highlight these issues! 👏"
"This is why you're my favorite creator. Always using your platform for good! 💕"
"I'm literally crying. You're such an inspiration for giving voice to the voiceless!"

Giving voice to the voiceless? She stole my footage. She stole Maya's story. She stole my documentary's entire concept.

I feel physically ill, a cold sweat breaking out across my forehead. This is my work, my vision, my carefully built relationship with my subjects—all hijacked and repurposed into Avery's brand of performative empathy.

My phone buzzes again. Maya.

**Maya**: Call me.

I tap her number with trembling fingers. She answers on the first ring.

"What the hell, Casey?" Her voice is tight with panic. "Why is my interview all over Avery's page?"

"I don't know," I say, struggling to keep my voice steady. "I didn't give it to her. She must have taken it from the school server somehow."

"Taken it? You mean stolen it."

"Yes, stolen it." The word feels inadequate for what's happened. This isn't just theft; it's an invasion, a violation of trust.

"It's got fifty thousand views already," Maya says, her voice rising. "People from school are texting me about it. They're saying I'm brave for 'opening up to Avery' about my 'digital trauma.' What am I supposed to tell them?"

The guilt hits me like a physical blow. "I'm so sorry, Maya. I had the footage on the school computer today. I left it for a few minutes to help Ms. Liu with something. Avery must have copied it then."

"Well, make her take it down! She can't just—" Maya's voice breaks. "That was supposed to be for your documentary. I trusted you with that."

The accusation in her tone cuts deep. "I know. I'll fix this. I promise."

But even as I say it, I have no idea how. The post is already viral. The damage is done.

After hanging up, I stare at Avery's post again. There's another video in the series already—a clip from my interview with a sophomore about content moderation, also stolen from my footage. The same treatment: moody music, desaturated color, Avery's voice narrating as if she's the documentarian.

I navigate to her Instagram Stories. There are five more snippets there, all from my raw footage, all repackaged with Avery's branding. She's released all of it at once, a coordinated content drop designed for maximum impact.

And it's working. Every clip has thousands of views, hundreds of comments praising Avery's "empathy" and "journalistic eye." Her follower count is ticking up in real time. She's gaining hundreds of new followers per minute.

With shaking hands, I report the post for copyright infringement. The platform immediately sends an automated response: "We've received your report and will review it according to our community guidelines."

I know this process. The review could take days, and without a registered copyright or verified creator status, my claim will likely be ignored. Especially against someone like Avery, whose sponsored posts generate revenue for the platform.

I try to think clearly through the panic. I need to contact Avery directly. I pull up her number—we exchanged contact information for a group project last year—and call her.

It goes straight to voicemail. Of course it does.

I send a text instead:

**Me**: I know you stole my documentary footage. Take down the posts immediately or I'm going to Ms. Santos, the principal, and your parents.

The message shows as delivered, but there's no response. I wait five minutes, then ten. Nothing.

My laptop pings with a new email notification. I open it, hoping it's a response from the platform about my report. Instead, it's an automated message from InstaFrame:

"Congratulations! Your content has been selected for the Explore page based on high engagement metrics. Keep creating great content!"

For a second, I'm confused. Then I realize—they're contacting Avery, not me. She's listed as the creator of the content that was stolen from me. The platform's algorithms are boosting her theft, rewarding her for content she didn't create.

The injustice of it burns in my chest. This is exactly what my documentary is about—how the system is designed to amplify certain voices while silencing others. Now I'm living it in the cruelest way possible.

I try to think strategically. I need evidence that the footage is mine. I search through my files for the original raw video files with their metadata and timestamps. I'll need to prove I filmed this before Avery posted it.

As I gather my evidence, I check Avery's post again. The view count has passed 150,000. New comments appear every few seconds:

"This series is everything! 🙌"
"You deserve a Pulitzer for this journalism"
"I never realized how toxic social media is for young artists"

I click over to Maya's profile out of habit, then remember she doesn't post anymore. But there's a new post—the first in over a year. My heart sinks as I read it:

"To everyone asking: Yes, that's me in Avery's video. No, I didn't know it would be shared this way. Please respect my privacy right now."

The comments beneath it are already filling with questions, theories, and a few cruel jabs disguised as concern. Maya has been dragged into the spotlight against her will, exactly what she's been afraid of since that first traumatic experience online.

I failed to protect her. I promised her footage would be handled with care, that her story would be told with dignity, and now it's being consumed as part of Avery's brand-building exercise.

My phone buzzes with a text. It's from Avery, finally.

**Avery**: Sorry, just saw this! What footage are you talking about?

The casual dismissal, the feigned ignorance—it makes my blood boil. I type furiously:

**Me**: You know exactly what footage. The interviews you took from the News Lab computer today. That's my documentary. Those are my interviews.

Her response comes quickly this time:

**Avery**: I think there's a misunderstanding. I've been working on this series for weeks. If there's some similarity to your project, it's just a coincidence. Great minds, right? 😊

A coincidence? My hands are shaking so badly I can barely type.

**Me**: It's not a coincidence. It's MY FOOTAGE. You stole it from the school server. Take it down now or I'm escalating this.

**Avery**: I understand you're upset, but these are serious accusations. I have all my own original files. Maybe we should talk about this in person tomorrow? Let's not make this a bigger deal than it needs to be.

Her condescension is infuriating. She's trying to gaslight me, to make me doubt what I know to be true. And the worst part is, she's in a position of power. She has the platform, the audience, the verification badge that gives her automatic credibility.

I'm about to respond when another notification pops up—a direct message from someone I don't recognize. The username is just a string of numbers and letters. The message is brief:

"I saw what happened with your footage. I can help. The system is rigged, but there are ways around it."

I stare at the message, wondering if it's spam or a troll. But something about the timing, the specificity...

Before I can decide whether to respond, my phone explodes with notifications. Maya is calling again, and there are texts from three other people who were interviewed for my documentary. They've all seen Avery's posts. They all want answers.

I look back at Avery's latest post. The view count is over 200,000 now. A small "Verified" badge appears next to her name, a symbol of authority granted by the platform. The caption has been updated:

"Overwhelmed by the response to this series. Your support means everything. More stories coming soon. This is just the beginning. 🎬 #RealVoices #DigitalDivide #UntoldStories"

Just the beginning. My stomach twists with dread. This isn't a one-off theft; she's planning to release more of my footage, to build an entire series from my work.

The platform has already decided she's the creator. The audience believes her. The algorithm is promoting her. The system is working exactly as designed—amplifying the voice that already has power, erasing the one that doesn't.

I stare at my phone, at the growing view count on content that should be mine, and a cold certainty settles over me. This isn't just about stolen footage anymore. This is about everything my documentary was meant to expose—the invisible barriers, the rigged game, the voices that get silenced.

Now my voice is one of them.

The stranger's message glows on my screen: "I can help. The system is rigged, but there are ways around it."

I hover my thumb over the reply button, unsure if I should trust this anonymous offer. But what choice do I have? The official channels have already failed me. The system is designed to protect Avery, not me.

As the notifications continue to flood in, I make my decision. I need to fight back, to reclaim my voice and Maya's trust. I need to expose not just the theft, but the entire broken system that makes such theft possible.

I need to finish my documentary—the real one—now more than ever.

But first, I need to stop Avery. Whatever it takes.

# Chapter 3

# CHAPTER 3

Sleep is impossible. I spend the night documenting everything, creating a timeline of events with screenshots, saving webpage archives, and collecting every shred of evidence that might prove the footage is mine. By morning, my eyes burn and my head throbs, but I have a folder labeled "EVIDENCE" filled with time-stamped files.

My phone screen is a disaster zone of notifications. Dozens of messages from Maya, texts from other students I interviewed, and comments tagging me on Avery's posts. I've ignored most of them, focusing instead on reporting every stolen clip through InstaFrame's copyright infringement system.

Mom knocks on my door at 6:30 AM. "Casey? You're up early."

I minimize the evidence folder as she enters. Her eyes widen when she sees me, and I realize how I must look—still in yesterday's clothes, dark circles under my eyes, surrounded by notebooks filled with frantic scribbles.

"Are you okay?" She approaches cautiously, like I'm a wild animal that might bolt.

"I'm fine." The lie tastes bitter. "Just working on a project."

She studies my face, unconvinced. "You don't look fine."

I consider telling her everything—how Avery stole my footage, how my documentary is being consumed under someone else's name, how the system is failing me exactly as I predicted in my film. But I remember her warning about not making waves, her fear that my project would lead to disappointment.

"I'll tell you after school," I say instead. "I need to figure some things out first."

She hesitates, clearly wanting to press further, but nods. "Okay. But you're eating breakfast before you leave. You look like you're about to collapse."

I force down some toast while checking InstaFrame again. Avery's stolen series now has its own highlight reel on her profile, labeled "THE UNHEARD." Overnight, her follower count has jumped by thousands. The algorithm is feeding her theft to more and more people, creating a viral snowball effect.

I have seven emails from the platform, all with the same message: "After review, we have determined that the reported content does not violate our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service."

Of course they haven't. Avery is verified. She drives engagement. She brings advertisers. The platform has no incentive to believe me over her.

Before leaving for school, I check the mysterious direct message again. "I can help. The system is rigged, but there are ways around it."

I still haven't responded. The offer is tempting but vague, and I don't know if I can trust a faceless stranger. But as I tuck my phone away, the message lingers in my mind—a sliver of hope in an otherwise hopeless situation.

---

North Point High feels like a different planet. The hallways buzz with an unusual energy—phones out, screens glowing, clusters of students huddled together watching and rewatching Avery's stolen content.

I keep my head down, trying to be invisible, but it doesn't work.

"Casey!" A sophomore I barely know waves me over. "Did you see Avery's new series? Your friend Maya is in it! It's so intense."

"Yeah, I saw." I don't stop walking.

"The part where she talks about getting those hate comments? I literally cried." She puts her hand over her heart. "Avery is so brave for highlighting this stuff."

I clench my jaw and keep moving. This happens three more times before I reach my locker—people I barely know approaching me to talk about Maya, about online hate, about how "amazing" Avery's series is. They've all watched it. They all have opinions on Maya's "digital trauma." They all praise Avery's courage.

Not one of them questions whether the story was Avery's to tell.

I spot Maya at her locker and rush over. She looks smaller somehow, hunched into herself, hood pulled up despite the school's no-hoods policy. When she sees me, her expression flickers between relief and accusation.

"Hey." I approach cautiously. "How are you holding up?"

"How do you think?" Her voice is low, tense. "Everyone's seen it. Everyone's talking about it."

"I'm so sorry, Maya. I spent all night reporting the posts, but the platform isn't doing anything."

She shoves a book into her locker with unnecessary force. "Blake Winters just asked if I was getting 'professional help' for my 'issues.' Melissa Chen wanted to know if I'd tried journaling about my 'online PTSD.' These are people who've never spoken to me before."

The guilt sits like a stone in my stomach. "I'm going to fix this. I swear."

"How?" Maya's eyes are red-rimmed from crying or lack of sleep, maybe both. "It's already out there. You can't put it back in the box."

Before I can respond, a familiar voice cuts through the hallway chatter.

"Maya! Casey! Just the people I wanted to see."

Avery approaches, radiant in a pristine white sweater and tailored jeans. Her smile is camera-ready, but her eyes are calculating. Two of her usual followers trail behind her, phones out but lowered, waiting for something worth capturing.

"I wanted to check in," Avery says, her voice dripping with practiced concern. "The response to the series has been overwhelming. So many people connecting with your story, Maya."

Maya stiffens beside me. I step slightly in front of her, a physical barrier between her and Avery.

"It's not your series," I say, keeping my voice steady despite the anger pulsing through me. "You stole that footage from my documentary."

Avery's smile doesn't falter, but her eyes harden. "I think there's some confusion. I've been collecting stories for weeks."

"No, you haven't." My voice rises slightly. "You took my interviews from the school server yesterday. I have the original files with metadata that proves it."

Several students have stopped to watch, sensing drama. Avery is acutely aware of the audience, her posture shifting subtly into performance mode.

"Casey, I understand you're upset." Her tone is gentle, reasonable—the voice of someone managing an irrational person. "Creative people often have similar ideas. It's not uncommon."

"This isn't about similar ideas." I'm struggling to stay calm. "You literally took my footage. The exact same interviews. The exact same shots."

Avery sighs, a perfect display of patience being tested. "Look, we're both passionate about giving voice to these issues. That's what matters, right? Not who gets credit."

The audacity of her statement leaves me momentarily speechless. She's reframing theft as a noble sacrifice, positioning herself as the selfless advocate while painting me as petty for wanting credit for my own work.

"You should be ashamed," Maya says suddenly, her voice quiet but clear. "You used my story without my permission. You made me a spectacle."

For a split second, Avery's mask slips. Annoyance flashes across her face before the concerned expression returns.

"I'm sorry you feel that way, Maya. That was never my intention. I just wanted to highlight important experiences that often go unheard."

"By stealing them," I interject.

The bell rings, saving Avery from responding. She gives us a regretful smile, as if we're the unreasonable ones ending a productive conversation.

"We'll talk more later," she says, backing away. "I really do want to make this right."

As she leaves, one of her followers raises their phone, capturing Maya's distressed expression for potential content. I step in front of the camera, blocking the shot.

"Delete that," I demand.

The girl lowers her phone, surprised by my aggression, then hurries after Avery.

Maya turns to me, her face pale. "I can't do this all day, Casey. I can't be the girl from the video that everyone's talking about."

"Let's go to Ms. Santos," I suggest. "She'll help us. She can talk to the principal, get the school involved."

Maya nods, defeated, and we head toward the News Lab.

---

Ms. Santos's reaction is everything I'd hoped for—immediate anger on our behalf, zero doubt that Avery stole the footage, and a determination to make it right.

"This is blatant theft," she says after watching the posts and reviewing my evidence. "And a violation of school policy. We'll take this to Principal Davis right away."

Relief washes over me. Finally, someone with authority believes us.

But the meeting with Principal Davis doesn't go as planned. He watches Avery's posts, examines my evidence, and listens to our story with a practiced neutral expression. When we finish, he leans back in his chair with a sigh.

"This is concerning," he says carefully. "But it's primarily a platform issue, not a school disciplinary matter."

Ms. Santos frowns. "With respect, sir, Avery accessed and took Casey's intellectual property using school computers. That's explicitly against our Acceptable Use Policy."

"Can you prove she accessed the server?" he asks. "Do we have logs showing her login?"

My heart sinks. "No, but I found her hall pass in the News Lab right after my footage went missing. And the timing matches."

"Circumstantial," he murmurs. "And even if she did access the server, proving she took the files would be difficult without technical logs."

"The identical footage isn't proof enough?" Ms. Santos asks, frustration edging her voice.

Principal Davis adjusts his glasses. "Ms. Santos, you know how these situations work. The Liangs are very involved parents. They've donated substantially to our STEM programs. If we're going to accuse their daughter of theft, we need ironclad evidence."

And there it is—the real issue. Avery's family has money and influence. Mine doesn't.

"So there's nothing you can do?" I ask, trying to keep the bitterness from my voice.

"I'll speak with Avery and suggest she consider crediting your work if there's an overlap," he offers. "But officially, this is between you and the platform's copyright system."

We leave his office with nothing but vague promises and "suggestions." Ms. Santos is fuming, her normally composed demeanor cracking.

"This is exactly why your documentary matters, Casey," she says as we walk back to the News Lab. "The system protects those who already have power."

"But what do we do now?" Maya asks, her voice small.

Ms. Santos considers this. "Keep pursuing the official channels. Document everything. And in the meantime, maybe consider a public response—set the record straight on your own terms."

"I tried posting about it," Maya says. "It just brought more attention and questions."

"What about finishing your documentary?" Ms. Santos suggests, looking at me. "The real version, with the full context. Truth is your best weapon here."

The idea resonates. My documentary was always meant to expose how the system silences certain voices—now it can include how that silencing happened to me in real time.

"I could do that," I say, feeling a spark of purpose returning. "But it won't solve the immediate problem. People are watching her version right now."

"One step at a time," Ms. Santos advises. "Focus on what you can control."

---

By lunch, the situation has escalated. Maya shows me her phone—dozens of direct messages from strangers who've seen Avery's posts. Most express sympathy, but others are more intrusive, asking personal questions about her anxiety or demanding to see the art that received hate comments.

"They don't even see me as a person," Maya says, scrolling through the messages. "I'm just content to them. A sad story they watched while waiting for their bus."

Across the cafeteria, Avery holds court at her usual table. She's speaking animatedly, her audience captivated. I can't hear what she's saying, but her body language is familiar—the gestures of someone telling an emotional story, a creator building her brand on human experience.

My experience. Maya's pain. Packaged and distributed for likes.

I check my phone again. Still no response from the platform about my reports. But I do have an email from InstaFrame's Creator Partnerships team—addressed to Avery, but copied to everyone tagged in her posts, including me.

"Congratulations on your impactful new series! Based on the exceptional engagement metrics, we'd like to discuss featuring this content in our Social Impact spotlight..."

The email goes on to offer Avery special promotional consideration and potential monetization opportunities for the stolen content. My stolen content.

I show it to Maya, whose face drains of color.

"They're going to pay her? For using my story without permission?"

"Not if I can help it." I stand up abruptly. "I need to try something else."

I leave the cafeteria and find a quiet corner in the empty band room. Taking a deep breath, I open the mysterious direct message from last night and type a response:

"Who are you and how can you help?"

The reply comes almost instantly:

"Someone who knows how the system works. And how to work around it. Avery Liang isn't the first to steal content and won't be the last. But there are ways to fight back that the platforms don't want you to know about."

I hesitate, then type:

"I've tried reporting it. The platform doesn't care."

"Of course they don't. They profit from her engagement. Official channels are designed to protect people like her, not people like you."

The message cuts uncomfortably close to the thesis of my documentary. I type:

"What exactly are you suggesting?"

"Meet me. In person. I'll show you how to level the playing field."

Warning bells ring in my head. Meeting a stranger from the internet is exactly what we're warned against. But desperation is a powerful motivator.

"How do I know I can trust you?"

"You don't. But ask yourself this: Who else is offering to actually help you?"

The question lands like a punch. Who else is helping? The platform ignores me. The principal dismisses me. Even Ms. Santos, for all her support, can only offer long-term solutions to an immediate crisis.

"I need to think about it," I reply.

"Don't think too long. Avery's building her brand on your work right now. Every minute counts."

I put my phone away, unsettled but intrigued. The stranger is right about one thing—official channels have failed me. Maybe unofficial ones are my only option.

---

After school, I head straight to the public library to use their computers, away from the school's network. I spend hours submitting more detailed copyright claims to InstaFrame, providing evidence of my original files and timestamps. I even attempt to contact their press office, hoping media attention might pressure them to act.

But with each rejection, each automated response, my hope dims. The system is working exactly as designed—protecting the verified creator, the one who drives engagement and revenue, not the actual owner of the content.

By the time I get home, exhaustion has replaced anger. I drag myself through the front door to find Mom waiting, arms crossed, expression grave.

"I got a call from Ms. Liu today," she says without preamble. "She mentioned something about your footage being stolen? And now you're in some kind of fight with Avery Liang?"

I drop my backpack on the floor. "Avery stole my documentary footage and posted it as her own. It's gone viral."

Mom's eyes widen. "Avery Liang? The influencer girl? With all the followers?"

"Yes."

"Oh, Casey." She sits heavily on the couch. "What did you do?"

The question stings. "What did I do? I didn't do anything! She's the one who stole my work!"

"I'm just asking what happened," Mom clarifies, but her tone suggests she's already assuming the worst.

I explain everything—how I left my workstation briefly, how Avery must have copied the files, how she's repackaged my interviews as her own series, how the platform is ignoring my copyright claims.

Mom listens, her expression growing more concerned with each detail.

"Have you tried talking to her parents?" she asks when I finish.

"Her parents?" I laugh bitterly. "Mom, her dad is a tech executive. They donated the computer lab at school. Nobody's going to take my side against the Liangs."

"You don't know that," she says, but her voice lacks conviction.

"I do know that. Principal Davis practically admitted it today."

Mom rubs her temples. "This is exactly what I was worried about. You're picking a fight you can't win."

"I didn't pick this fight!" My voice rises. "She stole my work!"

"I understand that," Mom says, attempting to sound calm. "But Avery has resources and connections we don't have. Her parents could make trouble. They could complain to the school. They could—" She stops abruptly.

"They could what?" I press.

Mom looks away. "Her father is on the board at Solas. If he wanted to, he could make things difficult for me at work."

The implication hangs in the air between us. My pursuit of justice could jeopardize Mom's job—our stability, our income, our home.

"So I'm just supposed to let her get away with it?" I ask quietly.

"I'm not saying that." Mom sighs. "I'm saying be careful. Think about the consequences. There are powerful people involved."

"That's the whole point of my documentary," I say, frustration building again. "The system protects people like Avery at the expense of people like us."

"And the system won't change because one high school student demands justice," Mom says bluntly. "That's not how the world works."

Her words hit like a slap. Not because they're cruel, but because they echo my deepest fear—that my documentary, my voice, my fight won't matter. That the system is too big, too entrenched to change.

"So what should I do?" I ask, hating how small my voice sounds.

"Maybe..." Mom hesitates. "Maybe just let it go. Delete your accounts for a while. Focus on school. This will blow over eventually."

Let it go. The suggestion is so contrary to everything I believe that for a moment, I can't respond. Let Avery profit from my work, from Maya's vulnerability? Let the theft go unchallenged, reinforcing the very system I'm trying to expose?

"I can't do that," I say finally.

Mom looks at me, a mixture of pride and worry in her eyes. "I was afraid you'd say that."

I retreat to my room, closing the door softly behind me. On my laptop, I open InstaFrame again, masochistically checking Avery's profile. Her follower count has grown by another twenty thousand. The stolen content now has millions of views across all platforms. She's been reposted by larger accounts, featured on content aggregators, mentioned in a popular culture newsletter.

She's turned my documentary—my vision, my work—into her breakout moment.

My phone buzzes with an email notification. Another automated response from InstaFrame:

"After a review, we've found the reported content does not violate our community standards."

The finality of the message feels like a door slamming shut. Official channels have failed. The system has spoken, and it has chosen Avery.

I stare at my phone, at the mysterious message still waiting for a response: "Don't think too long. Avery's building her brand on your work right now. Every minute counts."

The stranger is right. Every minute I spend following the rules, Avery's theft becomes more entrenched, more profitable, more "hers" in the public eye. The longer I wait, the less chance I have of reclaiming my work and my voice.

My documentary was meant to expose how the system silences certain voices while amplifying others. Now that system is silencing me in real time, proving my thesis in the cruelest way possible.

If I want to be heard, maybe I need to step outside the system's rules. Maybe I need to find another way.

I pick up my phone and type a response to the mysterious offer:

"When and where?"

---

# Chapter 4

# CHAPTER 4

Morning light filters through the blinds as I stare at my phone, the mysterious stranger's response glowing on the screen:

"Storage facility on Mercer Road. Unit 14B. 8 PM tomorrow. Come alone."

My heart pounds against my ribs. This is happening. I'm actually considering meeting an anonymous internet contact who might help me fight back against Avery. The desperation of it hits me like a wave—I've become every cautionary tale about internet safety we were taught in middle school.

But what choice do I have?

I send back a simple "I'll be there" before I can change my mind.

Maya's text interrupts my spiraling thoughts: "It's getting worse."

No context needed. I know exactly what she means.

I swipe to InstaFrame and immediately wish I hadn't. Avery has posted three more clips from my stolen footage overnight, each one garnering hundreds of thousands of views. She's created a custom animated intro for what she's now calling her "docuseries," complete with somber piano music and floating text that reads: "THE UNHEARD: Stories from the Digital Margins."

The comments section under the latest video is a mix of effusive praise for Avery and unsolicited advice for Maya:

"Avery's doing such important work giving these stories a platform 🙌"

"That Maya girl should try therapy, it really helped my anxiety"

"I can't believe people were so mean about her art! Post it again, we'll support you!!"

"@maya_restrepo we want to see your work! Don't let the haters win! #JusticeForMaya"

The hashtag makes my stomach turn. There's no justice here—just Maya's private pain becoming public entertainment.

I call her immediately.

"Hey," she answers, her voice small and flat.

"I saw. I'm so sorry."

"People are showing up in my DMs asking to see the art that got hate comments." Her words come out tight, controlled. "Like they're entitled to see my work because they watched a sixty-second clip about me. Some random guy said he'd 'protect me from the trolls' if I shared my drawings with him."

The violation of it all makes me physically sick. "Have you blocked them?"

"I've blocked dozens already. They just keep coming." She takes a shaky breath. "Someone made a fake account pretending to be me and posted random art they found online, claiming it was mine."

"What? That's—"

"Avery commented on it," Maya continues, her voice rising slightly. "She wrote this whole supportive paragraph about how brave 'I' was for sharing again. She didn't even check if it was actually me."

Of course not. Authenticity doesn't matter to Avery—only the performance of support, the appearance of empathy that builds her brand.

"I'm meeting someone tonight who might be able to help," I say, lowering my voice though no one else is home. "Someone who knows how to fight back against people like Avery."

"What do you mean? Who?"

I hesitate. "I don't know exactly. They messaged me offering help."

"A stranger from the internet?" Maya's voice sharpens with concern. "Casey, that's not safe."

"I know it sounds sketchy, but—"

"No, it doesn't just sound sketchy. It is sketchy. This whole situation is already bad enough without you meeting some random person who could be anyone."

She's right, of course. I know she's right. But the alternative is watching helplessly as Avery continues to profit from our stolen stories while the platforms and authorities shrug.

"I'll be careful," I promise. "But I have to try something. The system is completely failing us."

Maya is quiet for a moment. When she speaks again, her voice has a new edge. "Do what you want. But don't make it worse. I can't handle worse."

The line goes dead before I can respond. Another fracture in our friendship, another consequence of Avery's theft.

I slip my phone into my pocket and finish getting ready for school, each motion mechanical and distant. The weight of Maya's suffering sits heavy on my shoulders—a failure I can't escape, a wrong I haven't figured out how to right.

---

School is a minefield. Every hallway, every classroom brings the possibility of someone mentioning "the videos" or, worse, approaching Maya directly. By third period, I've overheard at least a dozen conversations about Avery's "brave new series" and intercepted three different students trying to ask Maya about her "online trauma."

In English class, I catch Jordan Seo watching me from across the room. Unlike the others, his gaze isn't curious or entertained—it's concerned, thoughtful. When our eyes meet, he gives me a small nod, and I find myself nodding back, a wordless acknowledgment passing between us.

After class, he approaches my desk as others file out. "Hey," he says simply.

"Hey." I stuff my notebook into my bag, not sure what else to say.

"I saw what's happening with Avery and your footage." His voice is quiet, matter-of-fact. "It's messed up."

The straightforward acknowledgment catches me off guard. Everyone else has danced around it, treating it as gossip or drama, not the theft it actually is.

"Yeah," I agree. "It is."

"I reported all the posts for copyright violation." He says it casually, like it's the most natural thing in the world. "Not that it'll do much good. The system's designed to protect people like her."

The echo of my documentary's thesis from his mouth makes me look at him more closely. Jordan Seo has always been on the periphery of my awareness—quiet, smart, part of the tech-focused crowd that Ms. Santos calls "the Debuggers" for their habit of fact-checking viral content. We've spoken maybe a dozen times in four years, usually in group projects or News Lab events.

"Thanks," I say, genuinely touched by this small act of solidarity.

He shrugs. "It's the right thing to do." He hesitates, then adds, "If you need help with anything, let me know. The Debuggers have some experience with this kind of thing."

Before I can ask what he means, the warning bell rings, and we both need to get to our next classes. But as I walk away, I feel slightly less alone in this fight, a tiny flicker of hope that not everyone is content to watch from the sidelines.

That flicker dies quickly when I enter the cafeteria at lunch. Maya isn't at our usual table. I scan the room and spot her huddled in a far corner, hood pulled up despite the dress code, shoulders hunched as she stares at her phone. Even from here, I can see she's shaking.

I weave through the tables to reach her. "Maya? What happened?"

She looks up, her eyes red-rimmed and wild. Without a word, she shows me her phone screen. It's open to a comments section under one of Avery's stolen videos. Someone has created a thread:

"Does anyone else think Maya is being way too dramatic? Like, everyone gets mean comments online. It's not that deep lol"

The replies are worse:

"For real! She's acting like she's the only person ever to get criticism 🙄"

"Maybe her art really was bad and she just can't handle the truth?"

"I found her old account and the drawings were actually pretty cringe ngl"

"She should be grateful Avery's giving her any attention at all. Who even was she before this?"

Each comment has dozens of likes, creating a cascading wave of mockery that's gained its own momentum, separate from the video itself.

"They found my old art account," Maya whispers, her voice cracking. "The one I deleted. Someone archived it and shared screenshots. They're pulling apart every piece I ever posted, finding all the old negative comments and adding new ones."

Cold fury rises in my throat. "Did you show Ms. Santos? Principal Davis?"

"What are they going to do?" She locks her phone and shoves it in her pocket. "Tell random internet strangers to be nice? This is exactly what I was afraid of. This is why I stopped sharing my art in the first place."

Her pain is a physical presence between us, made worse by the knowledge that I could have prevented this. If I had been more careful with my footage, if I had logged out of that computer, if I had noticed Avery's hall pass sooner—a thousand "ifs" that can't change what's happening now.

"I'm going to fix this," I say, the words hollow even to my own ears.

Maya doesn't respond. She just gathers her things and stands. "I need to go to the nurse. I can't be here right now."

I watch her leave, shoulders curled inward as if trying to make herself invisible. The cafeteria continues its normal buzz around me, students laughing and talking, unaware or uncaring of the destruction unfolding in plain sight.

---

Ms. Santos finds me in the News Lab after school, staring blankly at my laptop where I've been documenting the growing harassment.

"Casey," she says gently, pulling up a chair beside me. "Maya's mom called. They're keeping her home tomorrow."

I close my eyes briefly, absorbing this new blow. "Is she okay?"

"Not really. The comments have gotten pretty vicious." Ms. Santos's normally cheerful face is grave. "I've reported everything to the administration, but—"

"Let me guess. There's nothing they can do because it's happening outside of school." The bitterness in my voice surprises even me.

Ms. Santos sighs. "Essentially, yes. Principal Davis suggested Maya deactivate her social media accounts temporarily."

"Classic victim-blaming. She shouldn't have to disappear just because Avery stole her story."

"I agree." Ms. Santos leans forward, lowering her voice though we're alone in the room. "Listen, Casey. I understand how frustrated you must be. The system is failing you both in real time, exactly as your documentary predicted it would."

"So what do I do?" I ask, desperate for guidance from the one adult who seems to truly understand.

"Keep documenting everything," she says firmly. "Continue pursuing official channels, even when they seem futile. The paper trail matters." She hesitates, then adds, "And finish your documentary. The real one. It's more important now than ever."

"But that won't help Maya now," I argue. "By the time I finish the film, the damage will be done."

Ms. Santos's expression softens. "Sometimes our most powerful response isn't the fastest one. Sometimes it's about creating something that lasts beyond the immediate crisis."

Her words remind me of the mysterious meeting scheduled for tonight. A faster response. An immediate solution. The temptation of it pulls at me, despite the obvious risks.

"What if there was another way?" I ask carefully. "Something... less official."

Ms. Santos studies my face. "Casey, whatever you're thinking about doing, please be careful. Some solutions create bigger problems than the ones they're trying to fix."

The warning in her voice is clear, but so is the fact that she doesn't outright tell me not to pursue alternatives. There's an unspoken understanding between us—she knows the official system is failing, and while she can't endorse going outside it, she understands why I might.

"I'll be careful," I promise, the same words I said to Maya earlier.

Ms. Santos nods, unconvinced but unwilling to push further. "I'm here if you need me. For anything."

After she leaves, I check my phone to find a text from my mom: "Coming home late tonight. Board meeting at Solas. Leftovers in fridge. Love you."

The timing couldn't be better—or worse, depending on how you look at it. With Mom working late, I won't have to explain where I'm going at 8 PM. One less lie to tell. One less person to worry about.

I spend the next few hours organizing evidence and preparing for my mysterious meeting, trying to ignore the knot of anxiety tightening in my stomach. At 7:30, I grab my camera bag—partly as a security blanket, partly to document whatever happens—and head out, leaving a note for Mom that I'm at the library working on a project.

The storage facility on Mercer Road is on the edge of town, a sprawling complex of identical metal units behind a chain-link fence. The security gate is propped open when I arrive—a detail that immediately raises my alarm level from "high" to "critical." I check the address again, wondering if this is an elaborate trap.

But I've come too far to turn back now. Clutching my phone with 911 pre-dialed and my finger hovering over the call button, I make my way to Unit 14B. The rolling door is closed, but a standard entry door beside it is slightly ajar. A soft blue light spills from the opening.

My heart hammers against my ribs as I approach. Every instinct screams that this is how people disappear—walking alone into strange buildings to meet internet strangers. But another part of me, the part desperate for any solution to help Maya, pushes me forward.

I knock hesitantly on the metal frame. "Hello?"

"It's open," a voice calls from inside. "Come in."

Taking a deep breath, I push the door wider and step inside.

The storage unit is not what I expected. Instead of boxes and dusty furniture, the space has been converted into a makeshift office. Computer equipment lines one wall—multiple monitors displaying scrolling text I can't decipher, server towers humming in the corner. The air is warm from all the electronics, carrying the faint ozone smell of overheating circuits.

In the center of it all sits a figure in a rolling chair, backlit by screen glow. As my eyes adjust, details emerge: male, probably a few years older than me, with shaggy dark hair and a face that seems to exist in a permanent state of skeptical amusement. He wears a faded black hoodie with the sleeves pushed up, revealing arms covered in what look like handwritten notes and reminders.

"Casey Morales," he says, not a question but a confirmation. "The documentarian whose work was stolen by North Point's resident content vampire."

I stand my ground near the door, maintaining distance. "And you are?"

"Dex." He spins his chair to face me fully. "Dex Navarro. Though most people who need my help don't get a real name, so consider yourself special."

"What exactly is 'your help'?" I ask, still positioned for a quick exit. "Your messages were pretty vague."

Dex gestures to a folding chair near his workstation. "Have a seat. I'll show you."

I remain standing. "I'd rather know what I'm getting into first."

He shrugs, seemingly unbothered by my caution. "Smart. Trust should be earned, not given." He turns to one of his monitors and types briefly. "You're dealing with a system designed to protect people like Avery Liang while silencing people like you. The official channels—copyright claims, platform reports, school authorities—they're all rigged in her favor."

"I know that," I say impatiently. "That's literally what my documentary is about."

"And now you're living it." He continues typing. "Which is why you need someone who knows how to operate outside those channels. Someone who can level the playing field."

"By doing what, exactly?"

Dex turns the monitor toward me. On the screen is Avery's InstaFrame account—not the public-facing page, but what appears to be the backend, with analytics, drafts, and settings visible.

"By showing you how the system really works," he says, "and how it can be made to work for you instead of against you."

My eyes widen. "You hacked her account?"

"I prefer 'accessed without permission.' Hacking sounds so aggressive." His tone is light, but his eyes are serious. "I can show you exactly how she stole your footage, how she's monetizing it, and what she's planning to do next. I can help you reclaim your work and your friend's story."

The power of what he's offering hits me like a physical force. Direct access to Avery's account. The ability to see everything she's doing behind the scenes. A way to fight back outside the system that's failing us.

It's also completely illegal.

"I don't know," I hedge, torn between desperation and ethics. "I want to stop her, but breaking into her accounts seems—"

"She stole your intellectual property," Dex interrupts. "She's profiting from your friend's pain. She's causing real harm while the platforms and authorities look the other way." His voice hardens. "The rules are already broken, Casey. They were broken the moment she took what wasn't hers."

His words resonate with something deep in my chest—the burning injustice of watching Maya suffer while Avery thrives, the maddening reality that the system protects the powerful at the expense of the vulnerable.

But before I can respond, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It's a text from Jordan Seo, which surprises me enough that I check it immediately:

"Thought you should know—someone just created a hashtag targeting Maya. It's spreading fast and it's ugly. People are posting fake art with her name, making memes about anxiety. The Debuggers are reporting everything, but it's moving too quickly."

My stomach drops. I look up at Dex, who watches me with knowing eyes.

"Bad news?" he asks.

"They're targeting Maya directly now. Creating fake art in her name, making memes about her anxiety." My voice shakes slightly. "It's coordinated, deliberate."

Dex nods grimly. "Avery's followers. They're a powerful force when mobilized—even if she didn't explicitly direct them, she created the conditions for this to happen."

"How do you know it's her followers?"

He turns back to his computer, types rapidly, then shows me another screen—a private Discord server with hundreds of members, all devoted to Avery's content. The recent messages are disturbing:

"That Maya girl is getting way too much attention for being a victim"

"Avery's trying to help her and she's being ungrateful"

"Let's show her what real online hate looks like lol"

The coordination is chilling. What started as mockery has evolved into a targeted harassment campaign, all because Maya dared to publicly say she didn't consent to her story being shared.

"This is sick," I whisper, horrified by the casual cruelty.

"This is how the internet works," Dex counters. "Engagement drives everything, and nothing drives engagement like conflict and cruelty. Avery benefits from this—every comment, every share, every meme increases her visibility and influence, even the negative ones."

My phone buzzes again with another text from Jordan:

"It's getting worse. Someone posted Maya's address in the comments. Debuggers are mass reporting, but it's already been screenshotted and shared."

Ice floods my veins. "They doxxed her. They posted her home address."

Dex's expression darkens. "Now it's crossed from online harassment to physical danger." He leans forward, eyes intense. "So what's it going to be, Casey? Keep following the rules that are failing you and Maya, or fight back with tools that actually work?"

The weight of the decision presses on me—the risk of going too far, of becoming something I'm not, versus the certainty that doing nothing means watching Maya suffer more.

"I don't want to break the law," I say finally. "But I need to stop this before it gets worse."

"There are ways to fight back without breaking laws," Dex says, his tone softening slightly. "I can show you how to document the harassment in ways the platforms can't ignore. I can help you trace the doxxing to its source. I can teach you to protect yourself and Maya from further attacks."

He pauses, then adds more quietly, "But I can also show you how to do more, if it comes to that. The choice will always be yours."

The offer hangs between us—help with clear boundaries, but also the implication of more drastic measures if needed. It's more than I expected, both more reassuring and more terrifying.

"Okay," I say, finally taking the seat he offered earlier. "Show me what you can do."

For the next hour, Dex demonstrates various tools and techniques for documenting the harassment, securing our accounts, and tracking the spread of harmful content. He explains complex technical concepts in simple terms, showing a surprising patience when I ask questions. Despite his edgy exterior, there's something almost teacher-like in his approach.

As he walks me through setting up enhanced security measures, I realize I've never asked the most obvious question. "Why are you helping me? What do you get out of this?"

Dex's hands pause over the keyboard. For a moment, his carefully maintained veneer of casual cynicism slips, revealing something harder and more personal underneath.

"Let's just say I have experience with people like Avery Liang," he says finally. "People who use their power and privilege to take what isn't theirs, who profit from others' pain while the system protects them." He resumes typing. "Sometimes the only justice available is the kind you create yourself."

There's a story there—something personal that drives his mission—but I don't press. We all have our reasons for fighting the systems that fail us.

As I prepare to leave, armed with new knowledge and tools, Dex hands me a small USB drive. "Everything we covered tonight, plus some additional resources. Keep it somewhere safe."

I pocket the drive, suddenly exhausted by the day's events and the weight of everything I've learned. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet," he says, his expression unreadable. "This is just the beginning. The real fight is still ahead."

Outside, the night air is cool against my flushed face. I check my phone to find several missed calls from Maya and a flurry of texts from both her and my mom. The guilt of my unannounced absence hits me—I've been so focused on finding a solution that I neglected the people who are actually worried about me.

I call Maya first, apologizing profusely for disappearing when she needed me. She's still angry, still hurt, but relieved to hear my voice. The harassment has escalated to the point where her parents are considering reporting it to the police, especially after the doxxing. She sounds hollow, defeated, a shadow of her usual self.

"I'll come over tomorrow," I promise. "We'll figure this out together."

But as I hang up, I wonder if that's a promise I can keep. The scale of what we're facing—a coordinated online mob, a system designed to ignore us, a social hierarchy that values Avery's brand over Maya's well-being—feels overwhelming.

I've barely unlocked my front door when Mom engulfs me in a fierce hug.

"Where were you?" she demands, pulling back to examine me. "The library closed two hours ago. I was about to call the police!"

"I'm sorry," I say, genuinely contrite. "I was working on the documentary and lost track of time. I should have texted."

It's not entirely a lie, but the omission sits heavy in my chest. I don't mention Dex or the storage unit or the USB drive burning a hole in my pocket.

Mom studies my face, not fully convinced but too relieved at my safe return to press further. "Casey, this whole situation with Avery and the stolen footage... it's getting out of hand. Maya's mom called me, frantic about the online harassment. She mentioned your name—said you were trying to fight back somehow?"

The concern in her voice is palpable, edged with fear. This is the conversation I've been dreading—the one where I have to choose between my mother's peace of mind and my conviction that what's happening must be challenged.

"I'm just trying to help Maya," I say carefully. "The school isn't doing anything. The platforms aren't doing anything. Someone has to."

"That someone doesn't have to be you," Mom insists, her hands gripping my shoulders. "Casey, listen to me. The Liangs are powerful people. Avery's father sits on the board at Solas. He could make things very difficult for me—for us—if they decide you're causing trouble for their daughter."

The implication is clear, and it lands like a blow. My pursuit of justice could directly threaten our financial stability.

"So I'm just supposed to let Avery destroy Maya's life because her dad might mess with your job?" The words come out sharper than intended, born of frustration and fear.

Mom's face tightens. "That's not fair. You know I support you standing up for what's right. But this isn't some abstract principle—this is our livelihood. My job at Solas is what keeps a roof over our heads, food on our table, opportunities in your future."

"I know," I say, deflating slightly. "I know that. But Maya is my best friend, and she's suffering, and it's partly my fault. I can't just stand by and watch."

Mom's expression softens. "I understand that. Just... please be careful. Promise me you won't do anything reckless or illegal. Promise me you'll think about the consequences before you act."

The USB drive in my pocket feels suddenly heavier. What would she say if she knew about Dex, about the tools and knowledge he's offered me? About the temptation to step outside the rules that have already failed us?

"I promise," I say, the weight of the half-truth settling uncomfortably in my chest.

Later, in the quiet of my room, I insert Dex's USB drive into my laptop. A single encrypted folder appears, password-protected as he showed me. Inside are all the tools and guides he promised, meticulously organized and annotated.

But there's also a text file I don't remember him creating, titled simply "READ_ME."

I open it to find a short message:

"Casey—

The tools I showed you tonight will help you document and protect. But they won't change the fundamental imbalance of power. If you decide you want to do more than defend—if you want to truly fight back—there's something else you should see.

She uses the system to erase you. I use it to erase people like her. I can help.

The choice is yours.
—D"

I stare at the screen, the blue light illuminating my face in the dark room. The offer is clear: a path beyond documentation and defense, toward something more active, more aggressive. Something that could rebalance the scales of power, but at what cost?

The temptation is stronger than I want to admit. To have the power to make Avery feel as helpless as Maya does now, to turn the system against her the way it's been turned against us—there's a dark satisfaction in the thought.

But is that justice, or just revenge? Would it help Maya, or just satisfy my own anger? Would it challenge the system, or just make me part of its worst aspects?

I close the file without responding, but I don't delete it either. Tomorrow I'll check on Maya, document the ongoing harassment, and continue pursuing official channels—but tonight, the possibility of another path lingers in my mind, a shadow I can't quite banish.

# Chapter 5

# CHAPTER 5

The halls of North Point High feel different this morning—charged with an electric current of gossip and spectacle. People lower their voices as I pass, conversations dissolving into whispers, eyes following me with that peculiar mixture of fascination and relief that comes from witnessing someone else's disaster.

Maya isn't here. Her mother called the school this morning, citing "online harassment" as the reason for her absence. The official label makes it sound clinical, manageable—not the crushing, invasive violation that drove my best friend into hiding.

I stop at her empty locker, running my fingers along the metal edge. We've shared everything since seventh grade—secrets, dreams, fears. Now her pain has become public property, currency in Avery's social capital market. And I let it happen.

My phone vibrates in my pocket. A text from Maya.

**Maya:** Someone sent pizza to our house last night. Four deliveries. Different places. They have our address.

My stomach drops. This isn't just online cruelty anymore—it's crossing into the physical world, invading Maya's home, the one place she should feel safe.

**Me:** Did you call the police?

**Maya:** Mom did. They said to keep a record of "incidents" but couldn't do much else.

**Me:** I'm so sorry.

The words feel pathetic, inadequate. What good are apologies when Maya's life is crumbling in real time?

**Maya:** Not your fault.

But it is. I know it is. If I hadn't left my workstation unlocked, if I hadn't trusted the school's system, if I hadn't filmed Maya in the first place—a cascade of failures that led to this moment.

**Me:** I'm going to fix this. I swear.

**Maya:** How?

I stare at her question, Dex's USB drive burning a hole in my backpack. Last night, after finding his "READ_ME" file, I stayed up researching him—or trying to. Dex Navarro barely exists online. No social media profiles, no digital footprint beyond a few mentions in tech forum archives from years ago. It's as if he's deliberately erased himself from the internet—a ghost who knows how to navigate the digital world without being caught in its web.

**Me:** I'm working on it. Trust me.

Three dots appear as Maya types, then disappear. Whatever she was going to say, she decided against it. The silence hurts more than any accusation.

The warning bell rings, and I force myself to move toward first period. As I round the corner, I nearly collide with Jordan Seo.

"Sorry!" I stumble back, clutching my backpack.

"No problem." He steadies himself, then lowers his voice. "Hey, I wanted to check on you. After that doxxing situation last night... that was serious."

His concern catches me off-guard. Jordan and I have barely interacted outside of class projects, yet here he is, genuinely worried.

"Yeah, it's bad," I admit. "Maya's staying home. People sent deliveries to her house."

Jordan frowns, pushing his glasses up. "Classic harassment escalation. Online to offline." He glances around the hallway, then adds, "The Debuggers tracked the original doxxing post. It came from an account created yesterday, but we think it's connected to Avery's inner circle."

"Connected how?"

"The account followed eight people before posting anything. All of them are in Avery's main friend group." He shrugs. "Could be coincidence, but..."

"But it's probably not," I finish.

The second bell rings, and students rush past us toward their classes.

"I should go," Jordan says, already backing away. "But if you need help—technical help, documentation, whatever—let me know. The Debuggers have your back."

I nod, touched by the unexpected alliance. "Thanks."

As he disappears into the stream of students, I wonder what Dex would think of Jordan and his Debuggers. Would he see them as potential allies, or as rule-followers too constrained by the system to make real change?

---

By lunch, Avery's stolen series has been featured on a popular culture website. The article praises her "powerful documentary work" and "commitment to amplifying marginalized voices." Each word is a twist of the knife.

I sit alone at Maya's and my usual table, picking at a sandwich I have no appetite for. Across the cafeteria, Avery holds court, her expression somber as she shows something on her phone to her rapt audience. Even from here, I can see the performative nature of her concern—eyebrows knitted just so, head tilted at the perfect angle of empathetic listening.

My phone buzzes with an email notification. Another automated response from InstaFrame:

"After additional review, we have determined that the reported content does not violate our Community Guidelines. This case is now closed."

Case closed. Just like that. My evidence, my timestamps, my metadata—none of it matters. The platform has made its choice, and that choice is Avery.

A shadow falls across my table. I look up to find Ms. Santos standing there, a newspaper tucked under her arm.

"Mind if I join you?" she asks, not waiting for an answer before sliding into the seat across from mine.

"Any news?" I ask, hoping against hope that the school has reconsidered its position.

She shakes her head. "Principal Davis is standing firm. He spoke with Avery this morning—a 'gentle conversation' about 'proper citation of sources.'" The air quotes in her voice are audible. "No disciplinary action, no removal of content, no acknowledgment of theft."

"Of course not," I mutter. "Can't risk upsetting the Liangs."

Ms. Santos glances around, then leans forward. "Casey, I need to ask you something, and I need you to be honest with me." Her voice drops lower. "Are you considering... alternative methods of addressing this situation?"

The question sends a jolt through me. Does she know about Dex? About the USB drive? Has she somehow seen the texts on my phone?

"What do you mean?" I try to keep my voice neutral.

"I've been teaching long enough to recognize when a student is planning something outside the rules." Her eyes are kind but penetrating. "Your questions yesterday about 'less official' solutions got me worried."

I stare at my untouched lunch, weighing my words carefully. Ms. Santos has always been my ally, the one teacher who truly believes in my documentary and its message. But she's still part of the system—bound by policies, reporting requirements, professional ethics.

"I'm just trying to protect Maya," I say finally, not quite answering her question. "The official channels have failed. Completely."

"I know they have." She sighs, rubbing her temples. "And I understand the temptation to take matters into your own hands. But Casey, whatever you're considering—if it crosses certain lines, it could have consequences far beyond this current situation."

"What lines?" I challenge, a hint of defiance creeping into my voice. "The ones that protect people like Avery while letting people like Maya suffer?"

"The legal ones," Ms. Santos says bluntly. "The ones that could affect your future, your college applications, your entire path forward."

Her warning lands with the intended weight. I haven't told her about Dex, about his offer to "erase people like Avery," but she senses the direction of my thoughts. 

"I'm not planning to break any laws," I say, which is mostly true. At least for now.

Ms. Santos studies my face, not entirely convinced. "Good. Keep documenting. Keep pursuing the official channels, even when they seem useless. Build your case methodically." She stands, preparing to leave. "And Casey? Whatever happens, make sure you can live with the choices you make."

As she walks away, her words echo in my mind. Can I live with letting Maya suffer while I follow rules designed to protect the powerful? Can I live with stepping outside those rules, becoming something I've always stood against? There's no clear path, no easy answer.

Just the growing certainty that something has to change, and soon.

---

After school, I retreat to the empty band room to check my phone in private. There's a new text from Dex—which is strange, because I never gave him my number.

**Unknown:** Here's proof that I can help. Watch Avery's latest post at exactly 4:15 PM. Don't blink or you'll miss it.

I glance at the time: 4:13 PM. Heart racing, I open InstaFrame and navigate to Avery's profile. Her newest post is from twenty minutes ago—another clip from my stolen footage, this one featuring a sophomore talking about content moderation. It already has thousands of views and comments.

I hit play and watch, holding my breath as the seconds tick by. The footage plays normally at first—my interview, recut with Avery's voiceover and branding. But at exactly 4:15, something happens.

The video glitches. The screen goes black for three seconds. Then, in stark white text against the darkness, a single word appears:

THIEF

It flashes for five seconds, impossible to miss, before the video resumes as if nothing happened. I quickly check the comments to see if others noticed, and sure enough, new comments are flooding in:

"Did anyone else just see that???"
"WTF was that THIEF message?"
"Is Avery's account hacked??"
"I recorded it, uploading now..."

My phone buzzes again.

**Unknown:** 30 seconds of chaos to prove a point. Don't worry—I restored the original. I could have deleted it all, but that wouldn't teach her anything. Yet.

I stare at the message, a mixture of awe and apprehension washing over me. Dex just hacked Avery's account in real time, altering her content to send a message—both to her and to me. A demonstration of power, a proof of capability.

And I can't deny the spark of satisfaction I felt seeing that word—THIEF—blazed across her stolen content, if only for a few seconds.

I save Dex's number in my phone, then respond:

**Me:** How did you get my number?

**Dex:** Same way I accessed Avery's account. Systems are only as secure as their weakest point. Your school's directory has surprisingly poor encryption.

**Me:** That was risky. What if she traces it back to you?

**Dex:** She won't. Trust me, I've covered my tracks. This was just to show you what's possible.

I hesitate, fingers hovering over the screen. What he did was illegal—unauthorized access to Avery's account, manipulation of her content. A crime, even if it was temporary, even if it was justified.

But it was also effective. For the first time since this nightmare began, someone actually did something that made a difference, however small.

**Me:** What else can you do?

**Dex:** Meet me tonight. Same place. 7 PM. I'll show you the full range of options.

I should say no. I should tell Ms. Santos, report Dex's hack, stay firmly within the boundaries of what's allowed. That would be the responsible choice, the safe choice.

But then my phone buzzes with a text from Maya's mom:

**Mrs. Restrepo:** Casey, I think you should know that Maya's deleting all her digital art. Everything. Years of work. She says she "can't stand to look at it anymore." We're very worried about her. She won't talk to us.

The message hits me like a physical blow. Maya's art is her heart, her voice, her way of processing the world. If she's destroying it...

I text Maya immediately:

**Me:** Please don't delete your art. Please. It's too important.

Minutes pass with no response. I try calling, but it goes straight to voicemail. The silence is deafening.

With shaking hands, I text Dex:

**Me:** I'll be there.

---

The storage facility looks different in the early evening—less ominous, more mundane. Just rows of metal doors and padlocks, nothing to suggest that behind one of them sits a digital vigilante offering dangerous solutions to desperate people.

I approach Unit 14B with more confidence than last time, knocking once before pushing the door open. Inside, Dex has added another chair and a small table with energy drinks and protein bars—a sad attempt at hospitality that somehow makes this strange arrangement feel more real.

"Right on time," he says, spinning in his chair to face me. "I take it you saw my demonstration?"

"I saw it." I remain standing, still not fully committed to this path. "Avery's followers are freaking out, posting theories about who hacked her."

"Let them speculate." He gestures to the open chair. "It was just a warning shot. A taste of what's possible."

I finally sit, setting my backpack on the floor beside me. "Maya's destroying her art. All of it. Years of work, gone because of what Avery did."

Something flickers across Dex's face—a flash of genuine anger quickly masked by his usual cynical detachment. "That's what they do, people like Avery. They take what isn't theirs, twist it into something unrecognizable, and never consider the damage they leave behind."

"You sound like you're speaking from experience," I observe.

Dex's eyes meet mine, then slide away. "Let's just say I understand what it's like to have your story stolen and weaponized against you." He turns to his computer, changing the subject. "I've been monitoring the situation. The harassment against Maya is coordinated, deliberate. Look."

He pulls up several screens showing social media activity—comments, direct messages, private groups. The scale of it is staggering. Dozens of accounts targeting Maya, sharing her information, creating cruel memes from screenshots of the stolen footage.

"Some of this is organic—random internet cruelty," Dex explains. "But there's a core group driving it, feeding the frenzy. And guess who they all connect back to?"

"Avery," I say, though it's not really a question.

"Not directly. She's too careful for that. But her inner circle—these five accounts." He highlights several usernames. "They're the ones seeding the worst content, encouraging others to pile on. Creating sock puppet accounts to make it seem like a wider movement."

I lean forward, studying the evidence. "Can you prove they're connected to Avery?"

"Already have." He clicks to another screen showing a complex web of connections. "Shared IP addresses, account creation patterns, linguistic analysis. They're all operating from the same playbook."

The thoroughness of his investigation is impressive and unsettling. "How long have you been tracking this?"

"Since I first noticed your stolen footage going viral." He shrugs. "I follow certain patterns of content theft. It's a particular interest of mine."

"So you just happened to notice my situation?" I ask, skepticism evident in my voice.

Dex smiles thinly. "Let's just say I keep an eye on North Point's digital footprint. Your school has an interesting history of privilege-based content appropriation."

Before I can press further, he turns back to the main screen. "The point is, this isn't random. It's a calculated campaign to silence criticism and maintain Avery's narrative control. And it's working. Maya's being erased—her voice, her art, her truth—while Avery profits."

The injustice of it burns in my chest. "So what can we do? You showed me you can hack her account. Can you take down the stolen videos?"

"I could," Dex admits. "But it would be temporary. She'd restore from backup, claim a glitch, maybe even leverage the hack for sympathy. 'Poor Avery, victim of cybercrime.'" His voice drips with sarcasm. "We need something more strategic."

"Like what?"

He studies me for a moment, as if weighing how much to share. "There are several paths we could take. I can show you how to document everything in a way that creates an undeniable case—timestamps, metadata, server logs. Evidence so compelling that even the platform can't ignore it."

"I've already tried that," I say, frustration creeping into my voice. "They don't care."

"Because you haven't had the right tools or access points." Dex leans forward. "But that's just one option. The defensive play."

The implication hangs in the air between us. "And the offensive play?" I ask quietly.

"I can help you take back control of the narrative." His eyes lock onto mine. "Not just by reclaiming your content, but by exposing Avery for what she is. I have access to her private messages, her drafts, her search history. Everything she doesn't want the world to see."

The offer sends a chill down my spine—both tempting and terrifying. "That's... that would be wrong. Invading her privacy like that."

"Is it?" Dex challenges. "She invaded your creative work. She exposed Maya's vulnerability without consent. She unleashed a mob that's driven your friend to destroy her art and hide in her home." His voice hardens. "Where's the line, Casey? At what point does protecting yourself and your friend justify stepping outside the rules that have already failed you?"

It's the question I've been wrestling with since this began, the moral knot I can't untangle. I think of Maya deleting her art, of Avery's follower count climbing, of the platform's indifferent automated responses.

But I also think of Ms. Santos's warning about crossing lines, about being able to live with my choices.

"I don't know," I admit finally. "I want to stop Avery, but I don't want to become like her—using other people's pain for my own purposes."

Dex nods, seeming to respect my hesitation. "Fair enough. We start with defense, then. Documenting, securing, protecting." He turns to his keyboard. "Let me show you how to gather evidence the right way."

For the next hour, he walks me through advanced digital documentation techniques—how to create verifiable timestamps, how to extract metadata from video files, how to trace the origin of harassing comments. It's useful, practical knowledge, but it still feels insufficient against the scale of what we're facing.

As I prepare to leave, Dex says casually, "By the way, have you checked Maya's social media today?"

"She's not answering my texts," I say. "Why?"

"Because the harassment is getting worse." He pulls up a screen showing a public thread about Maya. "They're planning something bigger. A 'raid' on her accounts, coordinated for maximum impact."

My stomach drops. "When?"

"Tonight. Around 11 PM when engagement peaks." He shows me the planning messages, the casual cruelty of strangers organizing to torment someone they've never met. "They're calling it 'justice for Avery' because Maya dared to say she didn't consent to being in the videos."

Anger rises in my throat, hot and sharp. "This has to stop."

"It won't stop on its own," Dex says quietly. "The system rewards this behavior. Engagement is engagement, whether it's driven by compassion or cruelty." He pauses, then adds, "I could intervene. Disrupt their coordination, expose the ringleaders, create some consequences."

"How?"

"Ways you probably shouldn't know about." His expression is serious. "But I won't do it without your go-ahead. This is your fight, Casey. I'm just offering tools."

The weight of the decision presses down on me. If I say yes, I'm authorizing Dex to take actions that are probably illegal, definitely unethical by conventional standards. I'm crossing a line that I've always respected.

But if I say no, Maya faces another wave of harassment—potentially worse than what she's already endured.

My phone buzzes with a text from Maya's mom:

**Mrs. Restrepo:** Update on Maya—she's locked herself in her room. Won't eat dinner. Says she keeps seeing notifications even though she's deleted her apps. We're calling her therapist tomorrow.

Something breaks inside me—a dam holding back rage and helplessness. Maya is suffering, right now, because of a system that rewards Avery's theft and amplifies her followers' cruelty. Because platforms prioritize engagement over ethics, profit over protection. Because powerful people like the Liangs are insulated from consequences.

"Do it," I say, the words falling from my lips before I can reconsider. "Stop them."

Dex studies my face, making sure I understand what I'm authorizing. "Once we start down this path, Casey, it gets harder to turn back."

"I know." And I do know, with a clarity that should frighten me more than it does. "But someone has to do something real. The system is failing Maya, and I can't just watch it happen anymore."

He nods once, a gesture of respect and agreement. "I'll handle it tonight. They won't know what hit them."

As I leave the storage unit, stepping into the cool evening air, I feel something shift inside me—a transformation from passive observer to active participant. From documentarian to combatant. It should frighten me, this crossing of a boundary I've always respected. Instead, it brings a strange sense of clarity.

The rules were broken long before I decided to break them. The system was rigged from the start. Fighting within its constraints was never going to work.

My phone buzzes with a text from Dex:

**Dex:** One more thing. When this is over, your documentary is going to have a new ending. Make sure it's one you're proud of.

I stare at the message, understanding its implications. This isn't just about stopping Avery or protecting Maya anymore. It's about changing the system itself, exposing its flaws from the inside.

That was always the point of "The Signal"—to amplify voices the algorithm ignores, to reveal the invisible barriers that determine who gets heard and who gets silenced. Now I'm living that fight in real time, making choices that will shape not just my film, but who I become in the process.

I slip my phone into my pocket and walk toward home, my steps firm with newfound resolve. There's no going back now. The camera is no longer my only weapon, and observation is no longer my only role.

I've chosen a side in a war I never wanted to fight. And for better or worse, I'm committed to seeing it through.

# Chapter 6

# CHAPTER 6

I clutch my phone tightly as I walk to the storage facility. It's been two days since I authorized Dex to intervene in the planned "raid" on Maya's accounts, and the results were both impressive and terrifying. The coordinated attack fizzled before it began—the ringleaders' accounts were temporarily suspended, their planning thread vanished, and a mysterious technical glitch prevented new accounts from posting with certain hashtags. 

Maya doesn't know what I did—what I authorized—but she texted this morning to say the harassment had "weirdly died down." She even felt safe enough to log back into her digital art software, though she's still refusing to go to school.

Small victories. But Avery's stolen content remains online, still generating views and praise. The system continues to protect her. And now that I've stepped outside the rules once, Dex is eager to show me how much further we could go.

The storage unit door is cracked open when I arrive, blue light spilling out like water. I knock anyway, a formality that feels increasingly unnecessary as this strange partnership solidifies.

"It's open," Dex calls from inside.

I step in, immediately hit by the warm, electronic smell of too many computers in too small a space. Dex has upgraded his setup since my last visit—a new monitor glows on the far wall, displaying scrolling lines of code I can't begin to understand.

"Right on time," he says, spinning in his chair to face me. He looks different today—more energetic, his eyes bright with purpose. My agreement to let him intervene seems to have shifted something between us. "I was just compiling the data from our little countermeasure. Pretty effective, if I do say so myself."

"It worked," I acknowledge, setting my backpack down. "The harassment dropped off completely."

"Temporary solution to a persistent problem," Dex corrects, reaching for an energy drink. "But it bought us time to implement something more... comprehensive."

The way he says "comprehensive" sends a prickle of unease up my spine. I take the seat across from him, noticing he's pushed his sleeves up today. His forearms are indeed covered in handwritten notes—not random scribbles as I'd thought before, but what appear to be carefully written reminders, dates, and fragments of code.

"What exactly are you proposing?" I ask.

Dex sets down his drink and leans forward, suddenly serious. "Before we go any further, I think it's time you understood who you're working with. Who I really am."

I tense slightly. "Okay."

"My name really is Dex Navarro. I'm eighteen. Aged out of the foster system four months ago." He delivers these facts clinically, like reading from a medical chart. "I was in seven different homes between the ages of nine and eighteen. Before that, I lived with my mom, who worked three jobs and still couldn't make rent in this town."

The personal revelation catches me off guard. "I'm sorry, that sounds really hard."

He waves off my sympathy. "Not looking for pity. Looking for context. See, my mom was a writer. Good one, too. She wrote these children's stories—illustrated them herself, read them to me every night."

His voice softens almost imperceptibly, the only indication that this memory matters.

"When I was eight, she submitted one to a publisher. Got rejected, like most people do. Six months later, a nearly identical book appeared on shelves—written by the acquisitions editor's cousin. Same concept, same character names, even similar illustrations."

My stomach tightens. "They stole her work."

"Exactly." Dex's eyes harden. "My mom tried everything—contacted the publisher, hired a lawyer she couldn't afford, tried to tell her story online. But who was going to believe a single mom working three jobs over a connected industry insider? The system was designed to protect people like them, not people like us."

The parallel to my situation with Avery is impossible to miss. "What happened?"

"She got depressed. Couldn't write anymore. Lost one job, then another. We got evicted." His voice remains flat, but his knuckles whiten as he grips the armrest of his chair. "Child Protective Services stepped in when she couldn't get out of bed for a week. I went into the system. She..." He pauses. "She's not around anymore."

The weight of what he's not saying hangs in the air between us. I don't press for details.

"I'm really sorry, Dex."

"Like I said, not telling you this for sympathy." He straightens, professional mask sliding back into place. "Telling you so you understand why I do what I do. The system—every system—is designed to protect those who already have power and silence those who don't. I learned how to hack because it was the only way to level the playing field."

For the first time, I truly see Dex Navarro—not just the cynical hacker with an agenda, but someone shaped by profound injustice, someone who recognized the same patterns in my situation that destroyed his family.

"So that's why you reached out to me," I say. "You saw yourself in what happened with my documentary."

"I saw the same story playing out all over again." He nods. "Different characters, same plot. And I decided maybe this time, the ending could be different."

The personal connection changes things. Dex isn't just some anonymous vigilante—he's someone who understands exactly what's at stake, who has lived the consequences of the system's failure.

"Thank you for telling me," I say simply.

He accepts this with a quick nod, then turns to his computer. "Now, let's get to work. You ready to see what we're really up against?"

"Yes."

"Good." He types rapidly, screens changing faster than I can follow. "First, let me show you exactly how Avery stole your footage."

A new window appears showing what looks like a security log. "This is from the school's server. I accessed their backup records. Look at the timestamps."

I lean forward, scanning the data. There it is—evidence of someone accessing my project files at exactly the time I was helping Ms. Liu with the printer. The username isn't Avery's, though.

"ECampbell?" I read, confused. "Who's that?"

"Emma Campbell. Avery's best friend." Dex pulls up a student directory photo of a girl I recognize as part of Avery's inner circle. "Avery's smart enough not to use her own login, but not smart enough to use someone outside her immediate social group."

"So Emma downloaded my files for Avery?"

"Exactly. And here's what Avery did with them."

Another screen appears, showing a timeline of edits to my footage—the addition of music, text overlays, color grading. Most disturbing is the careful excision of any mention of me or my documentary, creating the illusion that Avery conducted these interviews herself.

"She worked fast," Dex notes. "Started editing within an hour of getting your footage. Had the first post ready by that evening. This wasn't impulsive—it was calculated, deliberate theft."

Seeing the methodical way Avery stole and manipulated my work makes my blood boil all over again. "This should be enough to prove she took it, right? The server logs, the edit history?"

"Should be. Won't be." Dex's voice is matter-of-fact. "The platforms don't care about server logs from a high school. They care about verified accounts, engagement metrics, and advertiser-friendly content."

"So what do we do?"

"We could keep fighting through official channels. File more detailed copyright claims, maybe try to get legal help." He says this with obvious skepticism. "Or..."

He types another command, and a new window appears. My breath catches.

It's Avery's private messages. Dozens of conversations laid bare—with friends, with brand partners, with followers. The invasion of privacy is so complete it makes me physically uncomfortable.

"This is crossing a line," I say, though I don't look away.

"The line was crossed when she stole your work," Dex counters. "I'm just showing you what we're really dealing with."

He scrolls to a conversation between Avery and Emma from the day of the theft:

**Avery:** Did you get the files?
**Emma:** Yeah. Downloading now. No one saw me.
**Avery:** You're the best 💕 This is exactly what I need for the pitch to Lumina.
**Emma:** Won't Casey be pissed when she sees it?
**Avery:** Who cares? By the time she figures it out, it'll be too late. Nobody will believe some random girl with no followers over me anyway.
**Emma:** True. What about the people in the videos? That anxious girl might say something.
**Avery:** Even better if she does. Drama = engagement. More eyes on me either way.

My stomach turns. The calculated cruelty is worse than I imagined. Avery didn't just steal my work—she specifically wanted Maya to object, knowing the conflict would drive more attention to her posts.

"Keep reading," Dex says quietly.

**Avery:** My Lumina brand deal is riding on this. They want authentic, impactful content that "starts conversations." This documentary stuff is perfect—makes me look socially conscious without actually having to do anything hard.
**Emma:** You're brilliant. Casey's an idiot for leaving it on the school server.
**Avery:** She's an idiot for thinking she could tell these stories better than me. Nobody would have watched her documentary anyway. I'm doing her a favor by giving these issues a platform people will actually see.

The breathtaking entitlement, the casual dismissal of my work and Maya's pain—it leaves me speechless. This is who Avery really is behind the carefully crafted persona of empathy and social awareness.

"And here's the most recent exchange," Dex says, scrolling forward. "From this morning."

**Emma:** People are asking questions about where the footage came from. That Jordan guy from the Debuggers posted something about original sources.
**Avery:** Ignore it. My follower count is up 15% since I started this series. Lumina is "impressed with my growth" and talking about making me a brand ambassador.
**Emma:** What if Casey can prove you took it?
**Avery:** She can't. And even if she could, nobody cares. I've already reshot some new interviews with people from my own circle to mix in with the stolen stuff. In a week, everyone will think this was my project from the beginning.

I sit back, stunned by the brazenness of it all. "She's planning to completely erase me from my own documentary. To replace me entirely."

"That's how it works," Dex says, no satisfaction in his voice despite being proven right. "People like Avery don't just steal content—they steal entire identities, entire narratives. They take other people's lived experiences and convert them into social capital."

He closes the message window and pulls up another screen—a comprehensive view of Avery's online presence, her follower growth, her engagement metrics, her posting schedule.

"She's built her entire brand on performance," he explains. "Everything is calculated for maximum impact. The clothes she wears, the causes she promotes, the people she associates with—it's all about optimization."

I think of Maya destroying her art, my documentary stripped of its purpose and voice, the platform's indifferent automated responses. All while Avery's influence grows, her theft rewarded with brand deals and recognition.

"This isn't right," I say, the inadequacy of the words burning in my throat.

"No, it's not." Dex leans back, studying me. "But now you understand what we're really fighting. Not just a teenage influencer who stole some footage, but an entire system designed to reward people like her at the expense of people like you. Like Maya. Like my mom."

The parallel hits hard. This isn't just about my documentary anymore. It's about something much larger—the same forces that silenced Dex's mother, that are silencing Maya, that would silence me if I let them.

"So what can we actually do?" I ask, the question weighted with new understanding.

"That depends on how far you're willing to go." Dex's expression is serious. "We have options ranging from simply exposing the truth to more... aggressive countermeasures."

"Like what?"

"We could start by undermining her credibility. Use the evidence we have to expose her theft publicly—not just to the platforms, but to her audience directly." He clicks through several screens, showing prepared materials. "Documentation, timestamps, server logs, private messages—all packaged for maximum impact."

It's thorough, compelling evidence that would be hard to dismiss. But there's a catch.

"Wouldn't revealing her private messages prove we hacked her accounts? Isn't that illegal?"

"Yes." Dex doesn't sugarcoat it. "That's the trade-off. Expose her, but expose ourselves too."

"What else?" I press, not ready to commit to self-incrimination.

"We could target her partnerships instead. Her messages show she's pursuing a deal with Lumina—that cosmetics brand popular with your demographic. We could provide evidence to them that their potential ambassador is a content thief."

This option seems more palatable—still aggressive, but targeting Avery's professional relationships rather than her personal life. "How would that work?"

"Anonymous tip with carefully selected evidence. Enough to raise serious concerns without revealing our methods." He shrugs. "Corporations hate bad publicity more than anything. They'll drop her at the first sign of potential scandal."

I consider this, weighing the impact against the ethics. "Would it hurt her?"

"Professionally, yes. Financially, definitely. Personally?" He tilts his head. "It would wound her ego and damage her brand. But it wouldn't destroy her. She'd recover eventually, probably with some tearful apology video that gets a million sympathetic views."

Part of me wants Avery to truly suffer for what she's done to Maya. Another part recoils from that impulse, recognizing how quickly vengeance can corrupt justice.

"What about Maya?" I ask. "How does this help her?"

"Directly? It doesn't." Dex is brutally honest. "It punishes Avery, but it doesn't undo the damage to Maya. For that, we'd need a different approach."

"Such as?"

"We restore balance. Take back control of the narrative." His eyes meet mine. "Complete your documentary—the real one—with additional footage showing exactly what happened. Turn this whole situation into the ultimate case study of your original thesis."

For the first time since entering Dex's digital lair, I feel a spark of true hope. This isn't just about revenge or justice—it's about reclaiming my voice, Maya's voice, the very purpose of my project.

"I like that," I say slowly. "But would anyone watch it? Avery has the platform, the audience."

"We'd need to create a moment—something that forces people to pay attention." Dex leans forward, energy in his voice. "And that's where my skills come in. I can make sure your documentary reaches the right eyes at the right time."

The implication is clear—he would use his hacking abilities to amplify my message, to break through the algorithmic barriers that would otherwise bury my work.

"That's still illegal, isn't it?" I ask, though with less conviction than before.

"In the technical sense, yes." He doesn't apologize for it. "But ask yourself this: Is following rules designed to silence you more important than telling the truth? Than protecting Maya? Than exposing a system that rewards theft and cruelty?"

His question hits at the heart of my moral dilemma. The system has already failed us. The official channels have protected Avery and abandoned Maya. Following the rules has gotten us nowhere but deeper into pain and injustice.

But crossing these lines means becoming something I've always stood against—using the same tactics I'm criticizing, fighting manipulation with manipulation.

"I need to think," I say finally.

"Fair enough." Dex nods, respecting my hesitation. "But while you're thinking, I have something to show you that might help you decide."

He pulls up a new screen—a private Discord server with Avery's name and profile picture.

"This is her inner circle's planning server. They're coordinating their next move." He scrolls through recent messages. "Now that the harassment has died down temporarily, they're worried about losing momentum. So they're planning something bigger."

I scan the messages with growing horror:

**Avery:** We need to keep this series going. The engagement is too good to waste.
**Emma:** What about Casey and her friends? They're still causing problems.
**Avery:** I have an idea. Let's do a livestream. A "community conversation" about digital ethics or whatever. We'll invite Maya to "share her perspective."
**Jason:** She'll never agree to that.
**Avery:** She will if we frame it as a chance to clear the air. And if she doesn't, we paint her as unreasonable and attention-seeking. Win-win.
**Emma:** Brilliant. When?
**Avery:** Next Friday. I'll announce it tomorrow. Make it seem spontaneous, like I'm just responding to "community concerns." Dad already cleared it with Principal Davis to use the auditorium after school.

They're planning to ambush Maya, to use her as a prop in Avery's performance of accountability while actually setting her up for more public humiliation. The calculation of it, the complete disregard for the damage they've already caused—it ignites something cold and hard in my chest.

"They're not going to stop," I say, my voice steady despite the anger coursing through me. "They're just finding new ways to exploit Maya."

"No, they're not going to stop," Dex agrees. "Not unless someone makes them stop."

I think of Maya deleting her art, hiding in her room, refusing to come to school. I think of Avery's messages dismissing my work, planning to erase me completely from my own project. I think of the platforms ignoring my evidence, the school protecting Avery because of her family's influence.

And I make my decision.

"Let's start with her sponsorships," I say, a strange calm settling over me. "Show me how to hit her where it actually hurts."

Dex's expression doesn't change, but something in his eyes shifts—a recognition, perhaps, of the line I've just agreed to cross.

"Alright," he says, turning to his keyboard. "Let's get started."

He pulls up a detailed plan for exposing Avery's content theft to Lumina, complete with carefully selected evidence that won't reveal our methods. It's thorough, strategic, designed for maximum impact with minimal risk to us.

"We'll need to create an anonymous email, route it through several proxies, and time the release carefully," he explains. "You'll want deniability if this ever comes back around."

As he walks me through the technical details, I feel a strange dissociation—like I'm watching myself from outside my body, observing this transformation from passive documentarian to active combatant. This isn't who I thought I was. This isn't what I ever wanted to become.

But as Dex said, the system is designed to protect people like Avery, not people like us. And sometimes, to be heard through all the noise, you have to change the frequency of your signal.

"One more thing," Dex says, pausing in his explanation. "Once we start this, there's no going back. Avery won't know exactly who's behind it, but she'll suspect. She'll retaliate. Are you prepared for that?"

I think of Maya's texts, of her art being destroyed, of Avery's casual cruelty in those private messages. I think of Ms. Santos's warning about being able to live with my choices.

"Yes," I say, the word heavier than its single syllable suggests. "I'm prepared."

Dex studies me for a moment, then nods. He turns back to his monitor, fingers flying across the keyboard. "Then let's give Avery Liang a taste of what it feels like to lose control of her own narrative."

He slides the keyboard toward me, cursor blinking at the ready. "You drive."

The invitation is clear—this is my fight, my choice. He's providing the weapons, but I have to be the one to pull the trigger.

I place my fingers on the keys, the physical connection to this digital act of rebellion making it suddenly, viscerally real. What I'm about to do crosses a line I never thought I would cross. It makes me a participant in the very system I set out to critique.

But it also makes me something else: someone who refuses to be erased. Someone who fights back. Someone who protects their own.

I begin to type, each keystroke a deliberate step into this new identity. The screen glows blue in the dim storage unit, illuminating my face as I leave behind the person I was and become someone new—someone capable of justice in a world where the rules are already broken.

For better or worse, I've entered the underworld. And there's no turning back.

# Chapter 7

# CHAPTER 7

The cursor blinks on the screen, patient and unassuming. My fingers hover over the keyboard in Dex's storage unit hideout. I'm about to help execute a plan that crosses lines I never thought I would cross—deliberately targeting Avery's sponsorship with Lumina. This isn't just reporting content theft anymore. This is active retaliation.

"Second thoughts?" Dex asks, his voice neutral. He's giving me space to back out, which somehow makes it harder to do so.

"Just... processing what we're about to do." 

"This isn't some random attack," Dex reminds me, rolling his chair closer. "This is targeted accountability. Lumina deserves to know who they're partnering with, and Avery deserves consequences for what she did to you and Maya."

I nod, trying to believe it's that simple. "So walk me through it again."

"We have two pieces of compelling evidence." Dex pulls up a folder on his main screen. "First, the server logs and timestamps proving Avery stole your footage. Second, the private messages where she explicitly states her plan to use the stolen content to secure the Lumina deal."

He clicks through several screenshots, each one a damning piece of evidence. "We're packaging this information anonymously and sending it to someone who can do something with it—without implicating ourselves in how we obtained it."

"And that someone is Eliza Chen," I say, recalling our earlier discussion.

"Exactly." Dex nods approvingly. "Local investigative journalist with a reputation for exposing corporate hypocrisy. Has a weekly column in the Meridian Bay Tribune and runs a respected social justice newsletter. Most importantly, she's one of Ms. Santos's former students."

The connection to Ms. Santos makes me uneasy. "Will this come back on her?"

"No. We're not mentioning Ms. Santos at all. I only brought her up because it's how I found Chen in the first place—your teacher's social media shows they maintain professional contact."

I take a deep breath. "Okay. And we're sure this won't be traced back to us?"

"Positive." Dex gestures to the complex setup on his desk. "We're using a secure email created through multiple proxies. The evidence we're sharing has been carefully sanitized of any digital fingerprints. As far as Chen will know, this could be coming from someone inside Lumina or Avery's own circle."

His confidence should be reassuring, but my heart still hammers against my ribs. This is really happening. I'm about to take an active step to damage Avery's career, her reputation, her brand deals.

"What exactly will happen to her?" I ask, needing to understand the consequences I'm setting in motion.

Dex leans back in his chair. "Best case scenario for us? Lumina pulls their sponsorship offer. Avery loses a significant revenue stream and professional opportunity. Her reputation takes a hit with other potential partners."

"And worst case?"

"Nothing happens." He shrugs. "Chen ignores our tip, Lumina doesn't care, Avery continues as if nothing happened."

But there's something in his tone, a careful neutrality that raises my suspicion. "You don't think that's what will happen."

"No," he admits. "I think there will be consequences. Just not enough to stop her completely."

The brutal honesty is somehow comforting. At least Dex isn't promising me fairy tale justice.

"Alright," I say, pulling the keyboard closer. "Let's do this."

Dex guides me through the process, helping me craft an email that's professional, concise, and devastating in its clarity. We attach the evidence—screenshots of server logs, timestamps, and most damning of all, Avery's own words about using stolen content to secure the Lumina deal.

TO: e.chen@meridianbytrib.com
SUBJECT: Influencer Fraud: Avery Liang and Lumina Cosmetics

Ms. Chen,

I'm contacting you anonymously with evidence that Avery Liang (200k+ followers) has stolen documentary footage from a fellow student at North Point High and is using this stolen content to secure a brand partnership with Lumina Cosmetics.

The attached files provide conclusive evidence of:
1. Server logs showing the unauthorized access of another student's project files
2. Private communications where Liang explicitly discusses using the stolen content to impress Lumina

As a journalist committed to exposing exploitation, I believe you'll find this story worthy of investigation. Lumina positions itself as an ethical company that champions authenticity. They deserve to know the truth about their potential brand ambassador.

A Concerned Source

The email feels simultaneously too strong and too weak—a nuclear bomb and a firecracker. I read it over three times, making small adjustments to the wording.

"It's solid," Dex assures me. "Professional, specific, compelling. Chen will take this seriously."

My finger hovers over the send button. This is the moment—the line between thinking about retaliation and actually doing it. Once I press this key, there's no taking it back.

I think of Maya deleting her art. I think of Avery's casual cruelty in those messages. I think of the system that has protected her while silencing us.

I hit send.

The email disappears into the digital ether, its path untraceable. The deed is done.

"Now what?" I ask, a strange hollow feeling spreading in my chest.

"Now we wait." Dex spins his chair toward another monitor. "Chen typically posts new investigations around noon. Let's see if she bites."

The waiting is excruciating. I fidget in my chair, check my phone repeatedly, pace the small confines of the storage unit. Dex seems perfectly content to monitor various screens, occasionally typing commands I don't understand.

"Is there anything else we should be doing?" I ask after thirty minutes of this torture.

"Patience, Casey." Dex doesn't look up from his screen. "Good things come to those who wait. Bad things too, sometimes."

"That's not reassuring."

"Wasn't meant to be." He glances at me. "This is the reality of what we're doing. Actions and consequences, separated by time and digital distance. Get comfortable with the discomfort."

His words linger in the air between us. Get comfortable with the discomfort. Is that what this new version of me needs to learn? How to sit with the knowledge of what I've done, waiting for the ripples to reach shore?

I pull out my phone and check Maya's Instagram. She's posted for the first time in days—a simple black square with white text that reads: "Still here." The comments are mostly supportive, with a few trolls quickly shouted down by others. The coordinated harassment seems to have genuinely faded after Dex's intervention.

A small victory, but a victory nonetheless.

"Any word from Maya?" Dex asks, noticing my focus on my phone.

"She posted something simple. The comments seem... better."

He nods. "The disruption worked. Trolls are lazy—they move on quickly when they meet resistance."

"Thank you," I say, realizing I haven't properly acknowledged what he did. "For helping Maya, I mean."

"Don't thank me yet." His expression remains neutral. "We've barely begun."

---

Three hours later, I'm back home, pretending to work on homework while obsessively refreshing Eliza Chen's social media and the Meridian Bay Tribune website. Dex sent me home, promising to alert me the moment anything happens.

My phone buzzes with a text from Jordan Seo, which still feels strange—we've exchanged more messages in the past week than in our entire high school career.

**Jordan:** Just checking in. How's Maya?

**Me:** A little better. The harassment died down some.

**Jordan:** The Debuggers have been mass reporting the worst accounts. Might be helping.

His casual mention of active help—real, tangible assistance without being asked—warms something in my chest. While I've been diving into Dex's morally dubious world, Jordan and his friends have been fighting the same battle through legitimate channels.

**Me:** Thank you. Seriously.

**Jordan:** No need. It's the right thing to do.

The simple phrase—"the right thing to do"—lands like a stone in still water. Is what I'm doing with Dex the right thing? Or have I strayed so far from "right" that I can no longer recognize it?

Before I can spiral further into ethical quicksand, my phone rings. Dex.

"Check Chen's Twitter," he says without preamble. "It's happening."

I switch apps so quickly I nearly drop my phone. There it is—a fresh tweet from Eliza Chen:

"Working on a developing story about content theft, influencer ethics, and corporate responsibility in the digital age. Sources with knowledge of partnerships between brands and teenage influencers, DM me. Confidentiality guaranteed."

My heart leaps into my throat. She took the bait.

"That was fast," I say, barely breathing.

"She's good at her job," Dex replies. "Based on her past work, she'll verify independently before publishing. Expect a full story within 24 hours."

"Do you think she'll name me?" The question slips out before I can stop it, revealing my lingering fear.

"Doubtful. You're a minor, and she has no way of knowing you're the student whose content was stolen. Her focus will be on Avery and Lumina."

His assurance helps, but anxiety still churns in my stomach. What have I set in motion?

"Get some sleep," Dex advises. "Tomorrow's going to be interesting."

---

Sleep is impossible. I toss and turn all night, imagining a dozen different scenarios for how this could play out. By morning, I'm exhausted but wired, checking my phone before my feet hit the floor.

Nothing yet from Chen, but there's a text from Maya:

**Maya:** Can you come over after school? Need to talk.

The message is cryptic enough to send a fresh wave of worry through me. Has something happened? Has the harassment started again?

**Me:** Of course. Everything okay?

**Maya:** Just need a friend.

The simplicity of her request tugs at my heart. With everything happening—the stolen footage, Dex, the retaliation plot—I've been so focused on fighting for Maya that I haven't just been there with her.

School drags by in a blur of anxiety and anticipation. I keep my phone on silent but check it obsessively between classes. Jordan catches my eye in English, raising an eyebrow at my obvious distraction. I shake my head slightly, unable to explain even if I wanted to.

It's during lunch when it happens. My phone buzzes with a notification from the Meridian Bay Tribune app—a breaking story by Eliza Chen:

"EXCLUSIVE: Teen Influencer Used Stolen Content to Secure Major Brand Deal"

My hands shake as I open the article. Chen has done her homework. The piece details how Avery Liang used "unauthorized content created by another student" to secure a partnership with Lumina Cosmetics. It doesn't name me directly, referring only to "a student documentarian whose work was appropriated without permission."

The article is meticulous, citing "server access logs" and "multiple sources familiar with the situation." It quotes a Lumina spokesperson as saying they are "deeply concerned by these allegations" and "reviewing their relationship with Ms. Liang."

Most damning of all, Chen somehow obtained additional confirmation of Avery's content theft—statements from two students I interviewed for my documentary, both confirming they never gave Avery permission to use their stories.

My phone buzzes again—a text from Dex:

**Dex:** Chen went further than we expected. She independently verified with your interview subjects. This is going to blow up.

He's right. Within minutes, the story is spreading across local social media. Students around the cafeteria are hunched over their phones, whispering and glancing toward Avery's usual table—which is conspicuously empty today.

A notification pops up from InstaFrame: Lumina Cosmetics has posted a statement.

"In light of recent allegations, Lumina is pausing all discussions regarding potential partnerships with Avery Liang while we investigate these serious claims. Authenticity and ethical conduct are core values of our brand."

A wild, fierce satisfaction surges through me. It worked. It actually worked. For the first time since this nightmare began, Avery is facing real consequences. The system that protected her has turned, if only slightly, in favor of the truth.

I check Avery's social media profiles. Her follower count has dropped by nearly a thousand in the past hour—a small dent in her 200K+ audience, but a dent nonetheless. The comments on her recent posts have shifted from adoring to questioning:

"Is it true you stole someone's documentary???"
"Disappointed if these allegations are real 😔"
"Always knew there was something off about your sudden 'interest' in social issues"

The schadenfreude is intoxicating, a dark and heady rush. I did this. I made this happen. The powerful, untouchable Avery Liang is suddenly vulnerable, her carefully constructed image cracking under the weight of exposed truth.

The satisfaction is so complete, so overwhelming, that it takes me several moments to notice the hollowness following close behind it. This doesn't fix Maya's pain. It doesn't restore my stolen work. It doesn't change the system that made all of this possible in the first place.

It's just revenge, dressed up as justice.

My phone buzzes with a text from my mom:

**Mom:** Principal Davis just called me. He wants a meeting tomorrow morning about an "online situation" involving you and Avery Liang. What's going on?

The bubble bursts. Of course the school would get involved now—now that Avery's reputation is at stake, now that the story has gone public. The same administration that dismissed my original complaints suddenly cares when their star student faces consequences.

**Me:** I'll explain when I get home. Promise.

I shove my phone in my pocket, the satisfaction curdling into anxiety. This was always going to have blowback. I just didn't expect it so soon.

After school, I head straight to Maya's house as promised. Her mom opens the door with a tired smile that doesn't reach her eyes.

"She's in her room," Mrs. Restrepo says quietly. "It's good you're here. She needs a friend."

Maya is sitting cross-legged on her bed, sketchbook open in front of her. She's drawing again—a simple line drawing of hands breaking free from chains. It's not her usual vibrant style, but it's something. A start.

"Hey," I say, hovering in the doorway.

She looks up, offering a ghost of a smile. "Have you seen the news?"

"About Avery? Yeah."

"Did you have something to do with it?" Her question is direct, her eyes searching mine.

I hesitate, caught between honesty and self-preservation. "I reported the theft to the platforms and the school. They didn't do anything. Someone must have taken it further."

It's not a lie, exactly, but it's far from the whole truth. Maya studies my face, and I wonder if she can see the changes in me—the hardening, the compromise, the moral lines crossed.

"Well, whoever did it, I'm glad." She closes her sketchbook. "It won't fix everything, but at least there's some justice."

Justice. Is that what I've achieved? Or just the first taste of power, the dangerous knowledge that I can hurt someone who hurt me?

"How are you doing?" I ask, desperate to change the subject.

"Better, I think. The harassment stopped suddenly yesterday. Like someone flipped a switch." She looks at me curiously. "Strange timing."

"That's good," I say, avoiding her implied question. "Really good."

We talk for a while about nothing important—school assignments she's missed, a new song we both like, normal teenage things that feel surreal after everything that's happened. It's comforting, this pretense of normalcy, even if we both know it's fragile.

When I check my phone before leaving, I see that Avery has finally responded to the story. She's posted a video—perfectly lit, her eyes artfully red-rimmed with precise teardrops clinging to her lashes. The caption reads:

"My truth. My heart is breaking that anyone would believe I would ever steal content. 💔"

I press play with a sense of dread.

"Hey guys," Avery's voice quavers perfectly. "I'm sure you've all seen the allegations going around. I just... I need to address this from my heart."

She takes a calculated breath, one delicate hand pressed to her chest.

"These claims about me stealing content are completely false. This documentary series has been my passion project for months. The fact that another student was working on something similar is just a coincidence—great minds think alike, I guess."

The audacity of her lie makes my blood boil.

"What's happening right now is a coordinated attack on my character and my work—work that was meant to give voice to important issues. I'm devastated that anyone would try to tear down a young creator just as she's starting to make a difference."

A single tear slides down her cheek with theatrical precision.

"Lumina has paused our partnership conversations, which breaks my heart because I was so excited to work with a brand that shares my values. But I understand they need to protect themselves from these malicious rumors."

She leans closer to the camera, eyes wide and earnest.

"To my true supporters—thank you for believing in me. I promise I will continue to create authentic content that matters, despite the haters and the jealousy. Truth always wins in the end."

The video ends with a soft, brave smile, a silent martyr facing persecution with dignity.

Within minutes, the comments section explodes with support:

"We believe you Avery! Don't let the haters win! 💕"
"People are just jealous of your success. Keep shining! ✨"
"Whoever is spreading these lies needs to GET A LIFE"
"Your real fans know the truth! We've got your back! 👊"

The narrative is already shifting. Avery isn't a thief facing consequences; she's a victim of hatred and jealousy. Her followers aren't rallying around truth; they're doubling down on their parasocial relationship with her carefully crafted persona.

And worst of all, it's working. The comment count is skyrocketing, the video spreading faster than Chen's article. Even negative engagement serves Avery's purposes—each angry comment, each accusation of lying, only feeds the algorithm and extends her reach.

My phone buzzes with a text from Dex:

**Dex:** Saw her response. Predictable. This is just the beginning, Casey. She's going to fight back hard now.

**Me:** So what do we do?

**Dex:** We hit back harder. Meet tomorrow?

I stare at his message, the dark satisfaction from earlier now completely replaced by unease. We've crossed a line, and Avery has responded exactly as expected—by playing the victim, by mobilizing her audience, by turning my attempt at justice into fuel for her own narrative.

The battle lines are drawn now, visible to everyone. There's no pretending this is just about stolen footage anymore. It's a digital war, with real-world casualties already mounting.

And I've just fired the first deliberate shot.

**Me:** I'll be there.

I send the response to Dex, sealing my commitment to this escalating conflict. For better or worse, I've chosen my path. I can only hope that when this is all over, the person I've become is someone I can live with.

Because right now, I hardly recognize myself.

# Chapter 8

# CHAPTER 8

My hands tremble as I walk through the crowded hallway of North Point High, phone clutched tightly in my palm. The article about Avery has been out for less than twenty-four hours, and already the school feels like it's been split into warring factions. Students huddle in corners, voices lowered as they debate whether Avery stole my footage or whether I'm just trying to take down a successful peer out of jealousy.

I catch snippets of conversations as I pass:

"But why would Eliza Chen publish it if it wasn't true?"
"Avery was crying in that video. You can't fake that kind of pain."
"I heard Casey's been out to get Avery since freshman year."

That last one makes me flinch. A completely fabricated narrative, already taking root. I've barely spoken to Avery before this, but the truth doesn't matter in the court of public opinion. Stories are currency, and the most engaging one wins—regardless of facts.

Principal Davis is waiting in his office when I arrive with my mom. His expression is grave, hands folded on his desk like he's presiding over a criminal hearing rather than a school meeting.

"Ms. Morales, Casey," he says, gesturing to the chairs across from him. "Thank you for coming in."

Mom sits stiffly beside me, her work uniform slightly wrinkled from her morning rush. She couldn't afford to miss a shift, but she insisted on being here. The contrast between her practical clothes and Principal Davis's tailored suit highlights everything this conflict is really about—power, privilege, and who gets to control the narrative.

"I assume you've seen the article in the Tribune," Principal Davis begins, not waiting for pleasantries.

"Yes," I answer. "It's about my stolen footage."

He winces slightly at the word "stolen," as if I've been impolite. "That's what I want to discuss. The school board is deeply concerned about this public dispute between students."

"This isn't a 'dispute,'" Mom interjects, her voice tight. "My daughter's work was stolen. She reported it properly through every available channel, and nothing was done."

Principal Davis sighs. "Mrs. Morales, I understand your frustration. But there's a significant leap from an academic disagreement over similar projects to a public accusation of theft in a local newspaper."

The dismissal is so complete, so casual, that for a moment I can't breathe. He's still pretending this is a misunderstanding rather than a clear-cut case of intellectual theft.

"Did you read the article?" I ask, struggling to keep my voice steady. "The journalist verified everything independently. She spoke to my interview subjects. She saw the server logs."

"Yes, and that raises another concerning issue." His tone sharpens. "How did those private server logs become public? Did you or someone acting on your behalf access secure school data without authorization?"

The question is a trap. If I admit that Dex hacked the school's system, I'm confessing to a serious violation of school policy, possibly even a crime. If I lie, I'm undermining the very evidence that proves my case.

"I don't know how the journalist got that information," I say carefully. "I reported the theft to you and to the platforms. Neither of you did anything. Someone else must have decided the truth needed to come out."

It's not technically a lie, but it feels like one. My hands are sweating.

Principal Davis studies my face, clearly not believing me but unable to prove otherwise. "Well, regardless of how it happened, we now have a situation that's reflecting poorly on North Point. The Liangs are extremely upset, and frankly, the board is concerned about potential legal action."

"Legal action?" Mom sits up straighter. "Against who? Casey is the victim here."

"Mrs. Morales, public accusations of theft can be considered defamation if not proven in court. And given that Casey is directly benefiting from this story..."

"Benefiting?" I can't help the incredulous laugh that escapes me. "How exactly am I benefiting? My work is still stolen. My best friend is still traumatized. Meanwhile, Avery's followers are attacking anyone who questions her."

Principal Davis frowns. "That's another issue we need to discuss. There have been reports of online harassment connected to this situation. The school has a strict anti-bullying policy."

The hypocrisy is so stunning I almost choke on it. Now he cares about harassment? After ignoring Maya's suffering for days?

"My daughter reported the harassment against her friend Maya," Mom says, her voice dangerously calm. "You did nothing."

"We investigated appropriately," he responds, defensive now. "But the situation has escalated, and—"

My phone buzzes in my pocket, interrupting whatever bureaucratic non-answer he was about to deliver. I wouldn't normally check messages during a meeting like this, but something—instinct, maybe—tells me it's important.

"Excuse me," I murmur, pulling out my phone. It's a text from Jordan Seo:

**Jordan:** SOS. Zach from your documentary is being targeted. BADLY. Check TrendUp app now.

My stomach drops. Zach Williams was one of the students I interviewed—a sophomore who spoke candidly about being bullied online after coming out as gay. He was also one of the people quoted in Eliza Chen's article, confirming he never gave Avery permission to use his story.

"I need to go," I say abruptly, standing up.

"Casey!" Mom looks startled. "We're not finished here."

"It's an emergency." I turn to Principal Davis. "One of the students from my documentary—Zach Williams—is being targeted right now because he spoke to the journalist. The harassment you claim to take so seriously? It's happening again, to someone else."

Principal Davis's expression shifts from annoyance to concern. "What do you mean, 'targeted'?"

"I don't know yet. But unlike last time, maybe you'll actually do something about it."

I rush out before he can respond, my heart pounding as I hurry down the empty hallway. Once I'm alone, I pull up the TrendUp app, a TikTok-like platform popular with North Point students.

What I see makes me physically ill.

Someone has created a thread about Zach, calling him a "snitch" and a "traitor" for speaking to Eliza Chen. But it goes far beyond name-calling. They've posted screenshots of his private Instagram, personal information from his student profile, and worst of all—his home address and phone number.

He's being doxxed, just like Maya was. But this time, it's explicitly because he supported me.

Comments flood the thread, each one worse than the last:

"Let's show this snitch what happens to people who mess with Avery"
"Anyone else think a surprise visit to this address would be funny?"
"Who's down to send a million pizzas to this loser's house?"

I frantically text Jordan:

**Me:** Just saw. This is horrific. Where is Zach now?

**Jordan:** He left school after 2nd period. Parents came to get him. Debuggers are mass reporting the posts but they keep making new accounts.

**Me:** Do you know who started it?

**Jordan:** Not confirmed but the original poster follows exactly 3 accounts: Avery, Emma, and Jason. Classic sock puppet.

The same pattern as the attacks on Maya—accounts connected to Avery's inner circle, mobilizing anonymous followers to do the dirty work while maintaining plausible deniability.

I feel sick. This is my fault. By exposing Avery publicly, I've put a target on the backs of everyone associated with my documentary. I was so focused on fighting back that I didn't consider the collateral damage—the other students who would get caught in the crossfire.

My phone buzzes with a call from Dex.

"Have you seen what's happening to Zach?" I demand as soon as I answer, ducking into an empty classroom.

"I'm looking at it right now," Dex responds, his voice tense. "This is Avery's retaliation. She's sending a message to anyone who might support you—speak up and get destroyed."

"We have to help him," I say, pacing the empty room. "They've posted his address, Dex. This isn't just online harassment anymore. He could be in physical danger."

"I'm already on it," Dex assures me. "I'm working to scrub his personal information from the threads. But Casey, you need to understand something—this is exactly what I warned you about. Avery's fighting back. And she's willing to hurt innocent people to protect herself."

The reality of what we've started hits me with crushing force. This isn't a clean, surgical strike against one person who wronged me. It's a messy, sprawling conflict with casualties I never intended.

"This isn't what I wanted," I whisper, leaning against a desk for support.

"I know," Dex's voice softens slightly. "But it's what happens when you challenge someone like Avery. She doesn't fight fair. She never has to—the system protects her, remember?"

The familiar anger flares again—at Avery, at the platforms that enable her, at a world where power so easily crushes truth. But it's tempered now by guilt and fear for Zach.

"I need to find him," I say. "Make sure he's okay."

"Be careful," Dex warns. "You're a target too. Meet me tonight, usual place. We need to adjust our strategy."

I hang up and immediately text Zach, but get no response. I try calling, but it goes straight to voicemail. The helplessness is suffocating.

As I step back into the hallway, I nearly collide with Jordan Seo.

"I've been looking for you," he says, adjusting his glasses. "Principal Davis made an announcement while you were gone. Emergency assembly about 'digital citizenship' tomorrow. Too little, too late, if you ask me."

"Have you heard from Zach?" I ask, ignoring the school's belated attempt at damage control.

Jordan shakes his head. "Not directly, but Lia from Debuggers knows his sister. He's home, parents are handling it. They're thinking about calling the police since it's technically harassment and doxxing."

"The police won't do anything," I say bitterly, remembering how little help they were with Maya. "Not until something actually happens to him."

"We're doing what we can," Jordan says, falling into step beside me as I walk toward my next class. "Setting up a monitoring system for any new threads targeting him, mass reporting the worst content, helping secure his accounts."

The matter-of-fact way he describes these actions—like it's the most natural thing in the world to organize a digital defense team for a classmate in trouble—catches me off guard.

"Why are you helping?" I ask, stopping to face him properly. "You barely know Zach. You barely know me."

Jordan looks genuinely confused by the question. "Because it's wrong, what's happening to him. What happened to Maya. What happened to you." He shrugs, as if it's the simplest thing in the world. "The Debuggers believe in digital ethics. We can't fix the whole internet, but we can try to make our corner of it a little less terrible."

His sincerity is almost painful to witness—a stark contrast to Dex's cynical worldview and my own growing bitterness. For Jordan and his friends, helping isn't about retaliation or even justice. It's simply the right thing to do.

"Thank you," I say, meaning it more than he can possibly know.

Jordan hesitates, then says carefully, "Casey, I don't know exactly what you're doing to fight back against Avery, but... be careful. There are lines that, once crossed, change who you are."

The warning hits too close to home, echoing my own growing unease about the path I'm on with Dex. Does Jordan somehow know? Has he guessed?

"What makes you think I'm doing anything?" I ask, trying to keep my voice neutral.

"Because I know you," he says simply. "You're a fighter. You wouldn't just accept what happened." He glances around the empty hallway, then adds more quietly, "And because the timing of certain things—the harassment suddenly stopping, the article appearing with server logs—it's not coincidental."

A chill runs through me. Jordan is more perceptive than I gave him credit for.

"I'm just trying to protect my friends," I say, not quite answering his implied question.

"I know. That's why I want to help." He pulls a small card from his pocket and hands it to me. It's plain white with a simple QR code. "The Debuggers have resources, Casey. Ways to document, protect, and defend that don't require... extreme measures."

The careful phrasing makes it clear he suspects I've ventured into Dex's brand of digital vigilantism.

"I'll think about it," I say, pocketing the card.

The warning bell rings, signaling we have one minute to get to class. Jordan nods and turns to go, then pauses.

"One more thing," he says. "Emma Campbell was bragging in the cafeteria about how 'actions have consequences' right before the Zach situation blew up. Might be worth looking into."

With that, he hurries off to class, leaving me with another piece of the puzzle—and more confirmation that Avery's inner circle is behind the attacks.

---

By lunch, Zach's doxxing has spread beyond TrendUp to other platforms. Screenshots of his personal information are being shared in group chats and Instagram stories, often with "jokes" about harassment or worse. The school administration sends out a generic email about "respecting privacy online," but does nothing to directly address what's happening.

I sit alone in the cafeteria, too anxious to eat, scanning social media for any updates on Zach. A shadow falls across my table, and I look up to find Avery standing there.

My whole body tenses. This is the first time we've been face to face since the article came out.

"Casey," she says, her voice perfectly modulated to carry just far enough for nearby tables to hear. "I think we should talk."

She's wearing a soft pink sweater that makes her look gentle and approachable. Her makeup is understated, her expression one of concerned sincerity. Every detail calculated for maximum sympathetic effect.

"About what?" I ask coldly. "About how you stole my footage? Or about how your friends are doxxing Zach Williams right now?"

Avery's eyes widen in practiced innocence. "I have no idea what you're talking about. I would never encourage harassment of any kind." She glances around, making sure people are watching this performance. "That's actually why I wanted to talk to you. This situation has gotten out of hand, and people are getting hurt."

The audacity is breathtaking. She's positioning herself as the reasonable peacemaker while her followers terrorize my friends.

"People are getting hurt because of you," I say, keeping my voice steady despite the anger pulsing through me. "You stole my documentary. You exploited Maya's story without her consent. And now Zach is being targeted because he told the truth about what you did."

"That's your perspective," Avery says with a sad smile. "I see it differently. I think we had similar creative visions, and instead of collaborating, you've turned this into a war. And yes, people are getting caught in the crossfire, which is tragic."

She leans in, lowering her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "But Casey, think about who started this public battle. It wasn't me. I never mentioned your name online. I never accused you of anything." Her eyes harden slightly, the mask slipping for just a moment. "You're the one who went to a journalist with stolen server logs and private messages."

A chill runs through me. How does she know about the private messages? Eliza Chen's article mentioned server logs but not the direct messages we provided. Either Avery is guessing, or she somehow knows exactly what evidence we gave Chen.

"I went to the journalist because you stole my work," I say, trying to keep my voice from shaking. "Because the school and the platforms ignored my reports."

"And now look what's happening," Avery gestures vaguely around the cafeteria. "The school's in chaos. Zach is being harassed online. My reputation is damaged." She sighs dramatically. "Was it worth it, Casey? Was vengeance worth hurting so many people?"

The framing is so twisted, so manipulative, that for a moment I can't even respond. She's completely inverting reality—painting herself as the victim and me as the vindictive aggressor. Worse, she's suggesting that I'm responsible for Zach being doxxed, rather than her followers.

"This isn't about vengeance," I finally manage. "It's about truth. It's about holding you accountable for what you did."

Avery stands up straight, her performance shifting from concerned peer to wounded innocent. "I didn't do anything wrong. And I certainly didn't tell anyone to harass Zach. If my followers are acting out, that's not my responsibility."

"You know exactly what you're doing," I say, standing up to face her directly. "You use plausible deniability to keep your hands clean while your friends do your dirty work. You're exploiting the same system flaws my documentary was trying to expose."

For a split second, something like respect flickers in Avery's eyes—an acknowledgment that I see through her tactics. Then it's gone, replaced by a camera-ready expression of hurt dignity.

"I came here trying to make peace," she says, raising her voice slightly so others can hear. "I'm sorry you're not ready for that. But Casey, whatever happens next... remember you had a choice."

The threat is thinly veiled but unmistakable. This isn't over. This is just the beginning.

As Avery walks away, head held high like a martyr leaving the coliseum, I notice Emma Campbell watching from a nearby table, a satisfied smirk on her face. Our eyes meet, and she doesn't look away—just pulls out her phone and starts typing, maintaining eye contact the whole time.

My phone buzzes seconds later with a text from an unknown number:

**Unknown:** Actions have consequences. Zach was just the warning shot.

I look up sharply, but Emma has already turned away, laughing with friends as if nothing happened. The message is clear: they know who to target, and they're just getting started.

My hands shake as I screenshot the text and forward it to Dex.

**Me:** They're threatening more people now. This is my fault.

**Dex:** It's not your fault. It's hers. And it's exactly why we need to shut her down completely. Tonight. 7 PM.

I stare at his response, a sick feeling growing in my stomach. Dex wants to escalate further, to "shut her down completely." But looking at what's happening to Zach—the real-world consequences of our digital war—I'm no longer sure that fighting fire with fire is the answer.

I pull out the card Jordan gave me and scan the QR code. It opens to a secure messaging platform with a single contact: "Debuggers Help."

I hesitate, fingers hovering over the keyboard. Dex offers power and vengeance, a way to hurt Avery as she's hurt us. Jordan offers ethics and community, a way to protect without destroying.

Two paths. Two very different versions of justice.

Before I can decide which message to send, my phone buzzes with a text from Zach Williams—the first response since the doxxing began:

**Zach:** They ordered 12 pizzas to my house. Parents are freaking out. Someone's posting pictures of our front door online. I'm scared, Casey. Make it stop.

The desperation in his message breaks something inside me. This isn't an abstract moral debate anymore. A real person is suffering right now because he supported me.

I need to do something. But what? Fight back harder with Dex and risk more collateral damage? Or try Jordan's approach and risk it not being enough?

The bell rings, ending lunch period and forcing me to pocket my phone without responding to either Dex or the Debuggers. But as I walk to my next class, one thing becomes crystal clear: this digital war has real-world casualties, and I'm partially responsible for every one of them.

The question isn't just what I'll do next. It's who I'll become in the process.

# Chapter 9

# CHAPTER 9

The library's overhead lights buzz faintly as I huddle in the corner carrel, phone pressed to my ear. I've skipped Chemistry to call Zach, ignoring the absence notification that will inevitably reach my mom. Some things are more important than perfect attendance.

"They won't stop," Zach whispers, his voice cracking. "Someone posted our home security camera on a map. My parents are talking about staying with my aunt in Sacramento."

My stomach twists with guilt. Zach is being driven from his home because he stood up for me—because he told the truth to Eliza Chen about never giving Avery permission to use his interview.

"I'm so sorry, Zach. This is all my fault."

"It's not your fault," he says automatically, but we both know it's not entirely true. I set these events in motion, even if I couldn't predict the outcome.

"Have you talked to the police?" I ask, already guessing the answer.

"They said to document everything and call back if someone actually shows up at the house." His bitter laugh holds no humor. "So basically, wait until it's too late."

I grip my phone tighter. "Jordan Seo and the Debuggers are helping report the posts. And I have... someone else looking into who's behind it."

I can't bring myself to mention Dex by name. Zach doesn't need to know about my venture into digital vigilantism.

"It doesn't matter who's behind it," Zach says tiredly. "Everyone knows it's Avery's crowd. But they're careful—using burner accounts, VPNs. No direct connection."

The bell rings, signaling the end of the period. My free block is over.

"I have to go to class," I say reluctantly. "But Zach, please keep me updated. And... I'm going to fix this somehow. I promise."

Another empty promise I don't know how to keep. What am I going to do—hack Avery's followers? Expose everyone involved? The collateral damage would be enormous, and I'd be no better than them.

"Just be careful, Casey," Zach warns. "They're not playing games anymore."

I hang up as students flood the hallway, their conversations creating a wave of white noise. I feel oddly disconnected from them—these normal teenagers with their normal problems, untouched by the digital war consuming my life.

As I round the corner toward English, a bright yellow flyer catches my eye. It's taped to the wall, professionally printed on high-quality paper:

COMMUNITY CONVERSATION
A Dialogue on Digital Ethics and Online Conflict
Hosted by Avery Liang
Friday, 4 PM - Auditorium
All Voices Welcome - Livestreamed on InstaFrame

My blood runs cold. This is the event Dex warned me about—the one Avery planned in her private messages to trap Maya in a public "conversation" designed to humiliate her. The timing is strategic, giving me only two days to prepare.

I pull out my phone to text Maya a warning, but before I can, someone taps my shoulder. I turn to find Ms. Santos, her expression grave.

"Casey. A word?"

She leads me to the empty News Lab, closing the door behind us. The familiar space—usually my sanctuary—feels claustrophobic today.

"I assume you've seen the flyers," she says, nodding toward the hallway.

"Just now. She's actually going through with it."

Ms. Santos sighs, perching on the edge of a desk. "Principal Davis approved it this morning. The Liangs called it a 'healing opportunity for the community.'"

"It's a trap," I say flatly. "She's going to use it to control the narrative and make anyone who opposes her look unreasonable."

"I know." Ms. Santos meets my eyes directly. "Which is why I'm concerned about what you might be planning in response."

I shift uncomfortably under her gaze. "What makes you think I'm planning anything?"

"Because I know you, Casey. And because things have escalated beyond what official channels can explain." She lowers her voice. "Server logs don't just appear in journalists' inboxes. Harassment campaigns don't suddenly stop without reason. You've found help outside the system."

My silence confirms what she already knows.

"I'm not going to ask for details," she continues. "But I need you to understand the stakes here. The Liangs aren't just wealthy, they're powerful. Mr. Liang sits on the board of three major tech companies, including Solas, where your mother works."

A chill runs through me. "How do you know where my mom works?"

"Because Principal Davis mentioned it specifically when he explained why we shouldn't pursue disciplinary action against Avery." Her mouth twists bitterly. "He seemed concerned about 'destabilizing the employment situation of a single-parent household.'"

The implication is clear: the school isn't protecting Avery just because of donations or reputation. They're actively using my mother's vulnerability as an excuse to do nothing.

"So what am I supposed to do?" I demand, anger rising in my throat. "Just let Avery get away with everything? Let her keep hurting people?"

"No." Ms. Santos straightens, suddenly every inch the teacher. "I'm suggesting you be smarter than they expect. This 'community conversation' is designed to provoke an emotional reaction—to bait you or Maya into looking unhinged on camera while Avery appears measured and reasonable."

"I know that."

"Then use it." Her eyes gleam with strategic intelligence. "Prepare. Document. Bring receipts. If you're going to enter the lion's den, make sure you're not the only one who ends up bloody."

For a moment, I glimpse a different Ms. Santos—not just a supportive teacher, but a fierce advocate who understands how power really works. It's both comforting and unsettling.

"Thank you," I say, genuinely grateful for the advice.

She nods, then adds more softly, "And Casey? Whatever help you've found... be careful whose methods you adopt. It's easy to become what you're fighting against."

The warning echoes what Jordan said yesterday, amplifying my own growing unease about working with Dex. Am I crossing lines that can't be uncrossed? Becoming someone Maya wouldn't recognize? Someone I won't recognize?

As if summoned by my thoughts, my phone buzzes with a text from Maya:

**Maya:** Have you seen the flyers? Avery invited me to her "conversation" personally. Said it would be "healing for everyone" if I shared my perspective.

My stomach drops. It's happening exactly as Dex predicted.

**Me:** Don't do it. It's a trap.

**Maya:** I know. But if I refuse, she'll use that against me too. "Maya was invited but declined to participate." Makes me look like I'm hiding.

She's right. Avery has created a perfect no-win situation: participate and risk public humiliation, or decline and be painted as unreasonable.

**Me:** We'll figure something out. Don't commit either way yet.

I slip my phone back into my pocket as the warning bell rings. Ms. Santos gives me one final look—part concern, part something like solidarity—before I head to class.

---

Mom is waiting when I get home, sitting at our small kitchen table with an expression that sends warning signals through my body. She's still in her work uniform, hair pulled back in a tight bun that gives her an unusually severe appearance.

"We need to talk," she says, gesturing to the chair across from her.

I drop my backpack and sit, bracing for whatever's coming. "Is this about skipping Chemistry? Because I can explain—"

"It's about Mr. Liang calling me into his office today."

My blood freezes. "What?"

"He wanted to discuss the 'unfortunate situation' between his daughter and mine." Mom's voice is controlled, but I can hear the underlying tension. "He was very polite, very concerned about how this 'misunderstanding' might affect workplace harmony."

"It's not a misunderstanding," I say automatically. "She stole my work."

"I know that, Casey." Frustration edges into her tone. "But Mr. Liang made it very clear that continued 'public accusations' could create an 'uncomfortable work environment' for everyone."

The threat is so thinly veiled it might as well be transparent. "He's threatening your job because I stood up to his daughter."

"He didn't say that explicitly. He didn't have to." Mom runs a hand over her face, suddenly looking exhausted. "He mentioned how difficult the job market is right now, especially for 'people without specialized technical skills.'"

Rage builds in my chest, hot and sharp. "That's blackmail."

"That's power," Mom corrects tiredly. "The kind we don't have."

"So what, I'm just supposed to back down? Let Avery keep lying? Let her friends keep harassing Zach and Maya?"

"I don't know, Casey!" For the first time, Mom's careful composure cracks. "I don't know what the right answer is. I just know that I can't lose this job. We can't afford it. Your college applications, our rent, everything depends on this paycheck."

The weight of her words settles on me like a physical burden. This isn't just about principle anymore. It's about our survival.

"I'm sorry," I say quietly. "I didn't mean for any of this to happen."

Mom's expression softens. She reaches across the table to take my hand. "I know you didn't. And I'm proud of you for standing up for what's right. I just..." She hesitates. "I'm scared, Casey. The Liangs have all the power here."

"Not all of it," I say, thinking of Dex, of his ability to expose Avery's private messages, to disrupt her digital world. "We have options they don't know about."

Mom's eyes narrow with concern. "What does that mean? What are you planning?"

I pull my hand back, unable to meet her gaze. "Nothing illegal." The half-truth tastes bitter on my tongue.

"Casey." Her voice sharpens with maternal intuition. "Tell me you're not doing anything that could make this situation worse."

"I'm trying to protect us," I insist. "To fix what Avery broke."

"By breaking something else?" Mom stands, pacing the small kitchen. "This isn't like you. The Casey I know documents injustice—she doesn't create more of it."

Her words hit like a physical blow, confirming my own darkest fears about what I'm becoming. The Casey she knows wouldn't work with someone like Dex. Wouldn't authorize hacks or leaked private messages. Wouldn't feel the dark satisfaction I felt watching Avery's sponsorship fall apart.

"I don't know what else to do," I admit, my voice small. "The system is failing us, Mom. The school, the platforms, the police—none of them are helping."

Mom stops pacing, her expression softening into something like resignation. "I understand that. But Casey, some fights can't be won—at least not in the way you want to win them."

"So Avery just gets away with it? Her family threatens your job and we just accept that?"

"I'm not saying that." She sits back down, taking a deep breath. "I'm saying we need to be strategic. Pick our battles. Find a way forward that doesn't cost us everything."

The pragmatism in her approach both frustrates and grounds me. Mom has always been the realistic one—the one who understands how the world actually works, not how it should work.

"Avery's hosting a livestreamed 'community conversation' on Friday," I tell her. "She's invited Maya to participate."

"That sounds like a setup," Mom says immediately, her instincts sharp despite her caution.

"It is. But it's also an opportunity. If we're prepared, if we have evidence ready, maybe we can use her own event against her."

Mom considers this, her practical mind working through the angles. "That's... actually not a bad approach. Public, but on terms you can control." She gives me a searching look. "Is that what you're planning? Just preparation and evidence?"

The question hangs between us—an opportunity to come clean about Dex, about the more aggressive options he's suggested. For a moment, I consider telling her everything.

But the thought of adding to her worries, of seeing disappointment replace the tentative approval in her eyes, stops me.

"Yes," I say, the lie coming easier this time. "Just evidence. Nothing reckless."

Mom seems to accept this, nodding slowly. "Okay. That sounds reasonable." She glances at the clock. "I need to start dinner. You have homework?"

"Some," I say, relieved at the change of subject. "But I promised to check on Maya first. She's still pretty shaken up."

"Of course." Mom's expression softens with sympathy. "Tell her she's welcome here anytime. Sometimes just not being alone helps."

I grab my backpack and head to my room, guilt settling in my stomach like a stone. I've never lied to my mom like this before. We've always been a team—just the two of us against the world. Now I'm keeping secrets that could affect both our futures.

But what choice do I have? If she knew what I was really considering with Dex, she'd try to stop me. And then what? Avery wins. The Liangs win. The system that protects the powerful and silences everyone else wins.

I can't let that happen—even if it means becoming someone my mom wouldn't recognize.

---

Maya's house feels different when I arrive—shutters drawn, porch light off despite the approaching dusk. Mrs. Restrepo answers my knock with a tight smile that doesn't reach her eyes.

"She's in her room," she says, stepping aside to let me in. "It's good you came. She won't talk to us about... everything."

The unspoken accusation hangs in the air. In Mrs. Restrepo's mind, I'm at least partially responsible for Maya's situation—for filming her in the first place, for fighting back against Avery and escalating the conflict.

She's not entirely wrong.

I climb the familiar stairs to Maya's room, knocking softly on her door.

"It's Casey," I call when there's no answer.

After a long pause, I hear movement, then the click of the lock. The door opens just enough for me to slip inside before Maya quickly closes and relocks it.

Her room is almost unrecognizable. The vibrant space once filled with color and art has been stripped bare. Her digital art tablet is unplugged and shoved under the bed. The cork board that used to display her sketches is empty. Even her colorful bedspread has been replaced with a plain gray blanket.

It's like she's erasing herself—removing everything that makes her Maya.

"Your mom's worried," I say, taking a seat on the edge of her bed.

Maya shrugs, curling up in her desk chair with her knees pulled to her chest. "She doesn't understand. None of them do."

"Understand what?"

"That it's never going to stop." Her voice is flat, emotionless. "Avery's stolen footage, the comments, the memes—they're permanent now. Part of the internet forever. I can delete my accounts, change my name, move to another city, and it would still follow me."

The hopelessness in her words breaks my heart. This is Maya—bright, creative Maya—reduced to a shell by the cruelty of strangers online.

"About Avery's livestream," I start carefully. "You don't have to go. We can find another way to—"

"I already told her I'll do it."

The words hit me like a physical blow. "What? Maya, no. It's a trap. She's going to use it to make herself look good at your expense."

"You think I don't know that?" For the first time, emotion cracks through Maya's flat affect—a flash of bitter anger. "But what choice do I have? If I don't show up, she controls the narrative completely. At least this way I can try to tell my side."

"She won't let you," I argue. "She'll twist everything you say, use her platform advantage to make you look unreasonable."

"So what's your brilliant alternative?" Maya challenges, unfurling from her chair to pace the small room. "Hide forever? Let her keep using my story however she wants? I'm tired of being afraid, Casey. I'm tired of feeling powerless."

The raw pain in her voice silences my objections. I've been so focused on fighting Avery that I've overlooked what Maya really needs—a chance to reclaim her own voice, her own story, on her own terms.

"Okay," I say finally. "If you're sure. But we need to prepare. Make sure you're not walking in there defenseless."

Maya stops pacing, turning to face me with a sudden intensity. "What about your friend? The one who helped stop the harassment?"

My breath catches. "What friend?"

"Don't play dumb." Her eyes narrow. "I know someone's been helping you. Someone with serious tech skills. The harassment didn't just magically stop on its own."

I hesitate, caught between protecting Dex's identity and being honest with my best friend. "It's... complicated."

"Complicated how? Illegal complicated?" When I don't immediately answer, Maya's eyes widen. "Oh my god, Casey. What have you gotten yourself into?"

"Nothing serious," I lie, avoiding her gaze. "Just someone who knows how to track online harassment better than the school or the platforms."

Maya studies my face, clearly not believing me. "This isn't you. The Casey I know wouldn't go outside the system like this."

It's almost exactly what my mom said, and the repetition cuts deeper. "The system failed us, Maya. It protected Avery and abandoned you. What was I supposed to do?"

"Not this." She shakes her head, disappointment evident in her eyes. "Not whatever shady thing you're doing that you can't even tell me about."

"I'm trying to help you," I insist, frustration building in my chest.

"I never asked for this kind of help." Maya turns away, wrapping her arms around herself. "I just wanted my friend. Not... whatever you're becoming."

The accusation hangs in the air between us, undeniable and damning. Maya sees it too—the shift in me, the moral compromises, the hardening edges. And unlike me, she isn't making excuses for it.

"I should go," I say quietly, standing up. "We can talk about the livestream tomorrow. Figure out a strategy."

Maya doesn't turn around, just nods slightly. "Yeah. Tomorrow."

I slip out of her room, the click of the lock behind me feeling unnervingly final. As I walk down the stairs, Mrs. Restrepo intercepts me in the hallway.

"How is she?" she asks, genuine concern overriding any lingering resentment.

"Not good," I admit. "She's agreed to participate in Avery's livestream on Friday."

Mrs. Restrepo's expression darkens. "We tried to talk her out of it. She won't listen."

"She feels like she needs to stand up for herself," I explain. "Take back some control."

"And what do you think?" Mrs. Restrepo's gaze is piercing, maternal.

"I think..." I hesitate, choosing my words carefully. "I think Maya deserves to tell her own story. But I'm worried about how Avery will use this opportunity."

"As am I." She sighs heavily. "This Avery girl—is she really so cruel? Or just thoughtless?"

The question catches me off guard. I've been so focused on fighting Avery that I've stopped seeing her as a complex person—reduced her to a villain in my narrative.

"I don't know anymore," I admit. "I think she's ambitious and calculating. I think she doesn't care who gets hurt as long as she gets what she wants. But maybe that's not the same as being deliberately cruel."

Mrs. Restrepo nods thoughtfully. "Maya used to talk about your documentary all the time. How it was going to expose the barriers that keep certain voices from being heard." Her eyes meet mine directly. "Don't lose sight of that purpose, Casey. Not even in the name of justice."

Another warning, another reminder of who I used to be. They're piling up, these cautions from the people who know me best, who see me changing in ways I can't fully acknowledge to myself.

As I walk home through the darkening streets, my phone buzzes with a text from Dex:

**Dex:** Plans for tonight? We need to prepare for Avery's livestream. I have ideas.

I stop under a streetlight, staring at the message. Dex's "ideas" have grown increasingly aggressive with each meeting. First documenting, then exposing, then directly attacking Avery's sponsorships. What will he suggest next? And am I willing to go along with it?

My thumb hovers over the screen as I weigh my options. I could cancel, tell Dex I need space to think. I could reach out to Jordan instead, explore the Debuggers' more ethical approach. I could try to handle this on my own, without either of their help.

But the thought of facing Avery's carefully orchestrated livestream without a powerful ally makes my stomach twist with anxiety. Maya will be there, vulnerable and exposed. Avery will have every advantage—platform, audience, the practiced performance of reasonableness. We need an equalizer, something unexpected to disrupt her control of the narrative.

And only Dex can provide that.

**Me:** I'll be there. 8 PM.

I hit send, then continue walking, a heaviness settling in my chest. My mother's concerned face, Maya's disappointed eyes, Ms. Santos's warning about becoming what I'm fighting against—all swirl in my mind, competing with the cold, hard certainty that playing by the rules will never be enough against someone like Avery.

The streetlights cast long shadows as I make my way home, my own shadow stretching before me—distorted, elongated, barely recognizable as my own. A fitting metaphor for what I'm becoming in this digital war.

I just hope that when it's over, I can find my way back to the person I used to be. The person everyone keeps reminding me I'm not anymore.

Because right now, I'm not sure that person still exists.

# Chapter 10

# CHAPTER 10

Friday arrives with the weight of inevitable disaster. The school buzzes with anticipation for Avery's "Community Conversation," students discussing it in hushed tones that fall silent when I walk by. Posters line the hallways, each one a perfect encapsulation of Avery's brand—soft colors, thoughtful typography, and words like "healing," "dialogue," and "understanding" arranged in an aesthetically pleasing formation.

Maya didn't come to school today. Her mom texted that she's saving her energy for the livestream this afternoon. The thought of her sitting alone in her stripped-down room, preparing to face Avery's carefully orchestrated public forum, makes my stomach twist with anxiety.

Jordan catches my eye across the cafeteria at lunch and approaches my table, sliding onto the bench across from me.

"Are you going?" he asks, nodding toward yet another poster.

"Not in person," I say. "Avery made it clear I'm not welcome in the audience. But I'll be watching."

Jordan's expression darkens. "This whole thing is a setup. The Debuggers went through the comment sections on Avery's posts about the event. Her followers are primed to attack anyone who questions her narrative."

"I know." I push my untouched lunch aside. "I tried to talk Maya out of participating, but she's determined. Says she needs to tell her side."

"We'll be there to support her," Jordan says, his quiet certainty a stark contrast to my churning doubt. "Some of us will be in the audience. Others will be monitoring the livestream comments, countering misinformation in real-time."

The offer of help—practical, immediate, ethical—makes my throat tighten. "Thank you."

Jordan hesitates, then adds, "Casey, whatever else you're planning... just be careful. Avery's counting on an emotional reaction. She wants to provoke someone into looking unstable on camera."

His insight matches what Ms. Santos told me, what Dex predicted. Everyone can see the trap but Maya, who's walking into it anyway out of desperate need to reclaim her voice.

"I should be with her," I say, sudden guilt washing over me. "I'm going to be watching from somewhere else, but Maya will be alone up there."

"She won't be completely alone," Jordan assures me. "Like I said, we'll have people in the audience. And sometimes facing something like this on your own terms is its own kind of power."

The bell rings, signaling the end of lunch. Jordan stands, adjusting his backpack.

"One more thing," he says. "Avery's team has been testing the livestream setup all morning. They've got professional lighting, multiple camera angles, and a moderated comment section. This isn't some amateur school event. This is a produced media spectacle."

Of course it is. Avery would never leave something this important to chance or school resources. She's treating this like a brand campaign, because that's exactly what it is—a carefully managed PR exercise designed to rehabilitate her image at Maya's expense.

"Thanks for the heads-up," I say, gathering my things.

Jordan nods and turns to go, then pauses. "Whatever happens today, remember this wasn't your fault. You didn't create this situation. Avery did."

His words are meant to comfort, but they ring hollow in my ears. I may not have started this, but I escalated it. Every step I've taken with Dex has raised the stakes, pushed Avery into increasingly desperate counterattacks. And now Maya is walking into the crossfire.

The rest of the day passes in a blur of anxiety and dread. I check my phone constantly for updates from Maya, but she's gone silent. Even my texts offering last-minute support go unanswered. By the time the final bell rings, my nerves are stretched to breaking point.

Instead of heading to the auditorium where students are already gathering for Avery's event, I slip out a side door and make my way across town to Dex's storage unit. We agreed to watch the livestream together, analyzing Avery's tactics and preparing our response.

Dex is already set up when I arrive, his usual array of monitors now arranged in a semicircle with the largest one in the center, ready to display the livestream.

"Right on time," he says, not looking up from his keyboard. "I've established multiple backup connections in case they try to block certain IP addresses. We won't miss a second."

"Has it started?" I ask, settling into the chair he's positioned next to his.

"Not yet. Scheduled for 4:15. They're still getting the audience seated." He glances at me. "You look terrible."

"Thanks," I mutter, dropping my backpack at my feet.

"I mean it. You look like you haven't slept." His tone shifts from dismissive to something almost like concern. "This is getting to you."

"Of course it's getting to me. Maya's about to be publicly ambushed and there's nothing I can do to stop it."

Dex turns back to his monitors. "There's plenty we could do to stop it. Crash the school's network. Hack the livestream. Send an anonymous bomb threat. But you vetoed all those options."

The casual way he lists potentially criminal actions makes my skin crawl. "Because they're extreme and dangerous."

"And what Avery's doing isn't?" he challenges. "Psychological warfare in front of a live audience isn't extreme?"

Before I can respond, the largest monitor flickers to life as the livestream begins. The school auditorium has been transformed—professional lighting creates a warm, intimate atmosphere on stage where two comfortable chairs face each other. A third, slightly separated chair sits off to the side, presumably for the moderator.

The comment section is already active, messages scrolling faster than I can read:

"So excited for this conversation! ❤️"
"Queen Avery handling this with such grace 👑"
"Can't wait to hear the real story!"

Dex snorts. "Pre-seeded comments. Her team loaded these up to set the tone."

The camera pans across the audience—students, some parents, a few teachers including Ms. Santos, whose face is carefully neutral. I spot Jordan in the third row, surrounded by what must be other Debuggers, their expressions alert and watchful.

A hush falls as Avery walks onto the stage, the picture of composed sincerity in a soft blue sweater that makes her look both approachable and serious. Her hair is pulled back in a simple ponytail, her makeup minimal—a calculated rejection of her usual polished aesthetic, designed to convey authenticity for this particular performance.

"Masterful," Dex murmurs, a reluctant admiration in his voice. "Every visual cue carefully selected to position herself as the reasonable, mature party."

Avery takes a seat and leans toward the camera with a warm smile. "Hi everyone. Thank you so much for joining today, both here in person and online. I know there's been a lot of confusion and hurt feelings in our community lately, and I wanted to create a space where we could have an open, honest conversation about what's happened."

Her voice carries just the right notes of concern and compassion. If I didn't know better, I might actually believe she cares.

"I'll be joined shortly by Maya Restrepo, who's graciously agreed to share her perspective. Before she comes out, I want to set some ground rules." Avery looks directly into the camera. "This isn't about blame or accusations. This is about healing, understanding, and moving forward together."

The framing is perfect—positioning herself as a peacemaker while subtly suggesting that any direct confrontation would be inappropriate and counterproductive. She's establishing the parameters of acceptable discourse before Maya even has a chance to speak.

A woman I don't recognize joins Avery on stage—sleek, professional, with the polished demeanor of a media consultant. "This is Julia Rodriguez," Avery explains. "A communication specialist who's kindly offered to moderate our conversation to make sure we stay focused on constructive dialogue."

Dex makes a disgusted noise. "Communication specialist. PR damage control expert, more like."

The moderator smiles warmly at the camera. "Thank you, Avery. As she mentioned, I'm here to facilitate a productive conversation. This means keeping things respectful, balanced, and solutions-oriented."

Translation: any raw emotion or direct accusation from Maya will be shut down as "unproductive."

"Now, let's welcome Maya to the stage," Julia says, gesturing toward the wings.

My heart contracts painfully as Maya appears. She looks so small under the professional lighting, dressed in a sweater I recognize as her favorite—a comfort object disguised as a fashion choice. Her face is pale, her movements stiff as she takes the seat opposite Avery.

"Maya, thank you so much for being here," Avery says, leaning forward with a perfect simulation of warmth. "I know this hasn't been an easy time for you."

Maya nods jerkily, her hands clasped tightly in her lap. "Thanks for having me."

The moderator smiles encouragingly. "Let's start by acknowledging that there have been misunderstandings and hurt feelings on all sides. Avery, why don't you share what you were trying to accomplish with your documentary series?"

And just like that, the trap begins to close. By framing the theft of my work as "misunderstandings" and positioning Avery to speak first, the moderator has already tilted the playing field.

Avery adopts a thoughtful expression. "I've always been passionate about giving voice to important issues in our community. When I started my series, my intention was to highlight stories that often go untold—to use my platform to amplify voices that might not otherwise be heard."

The irony is so thick I could choke on it. She's literally describing the purpose of my documentary while pretending it was her idea all along.

"I interviewed several students, including Maya, about their experiences with online culture and digital pressures. What struck me most was the authenticity and courage in their stories." Avery's voice softens with practiced empathy. "I felt a responsibility to share these important perspectives with a wider audience."

Not a single mention of me or the fact that she stole these interviews. Just a complete rewriting of history, delivered with such conviction that I wonder if she's started to believe her own lies.

"Maya," the moderator turns to her, "can you share your experience of being featured in Avery's series?"

Maya shifts uncomfortably, visibly struggling to find her footing in this carefully controlled narrative. "Well, that's the thing. It wasn't Avery's series. Those interviews were for Casey Morales's documentary about digital inequality. I agreed to talk to Casey because she's my friend and I trusted her. I never gave permission for Avery to use that footage."

A flicker of annoyance crosses Avery's face before she replaces it with concerned confusion. "I think there's been a misunderstanding. The interviews I used were conducted with full knowledge of everyone involved."

"That's not true," Maya insists, her voice rising slightly. "Casey filmed me in my bedroom. You weren't even there."

The moderator steps in smoothly. "It seems we have different recollections of events. Rather than focus on who said what to whom, let's talk about the impact. Maya, how did you feel when you saw your story being shared online?"

The redirection is subtle but effective, steering the conversation away from the concrete fact of theft and toward the more subjective territory of feelings and perceptions.

"Violated," Maya says bluntly, a small spark of the real her breaking through. "I shared personal things about my anxiety and online harassment with Casey for her documentary. Then suddenly it's all over InstaFrame with Avery's voice talking over it, and thousands of people commenting on the most vulnerable moment of my life."

Avery adopts a pained expression. "I'm truly sorry you felt that way. That was never my intention. I believed I was helping by bringing these important issues to light."

"You didn't help," Maya counters, her hands now visibly shaking in her lap. "You made everything worse. People started harassing me again because of your posts. They doxxed my address. They sent pizzas to my house. They turned my anxiety into a joke."

A murmur runs through the audience. This is the first time the harassment has been publicly mentioned, and I can see Avery calculating her response.

"I was horrified to hear about that harassment," she says carefully. "Online cruelty is never acceptable, and I've always been clear with my followers about the importance of respectful engagement. If anyone used my content as an excuse to harass you, that goes against everything I stand for."

The denial of responsibility is masterful—expressing sympathy while completely distancing herself from the consequences of her actions. I can see Maya's frustration mounting as Avery once again slips free of accountability.

"Let's take a step back," the moderator suggests. "Maya, do you think sharing stories about mental health struggles online can be helpful to others in some contexts?"

The question is a trap, designed to force Maya into either contradicting herself or appearing unreasonable. If she says yes, it undermines her criticism of Avery. If she says no, she seems regressive and anti-awareness.

"That's not the point," Maya says, her voice tightening. "The point is consent. I consented to share my story with Casey for her documentary. I never consented to have it stolen and repackaged by someone else."

"No one stole anything," Avery says, her voice taking on a hint of steel beneath the compassionate veneer. "These are similar projects with overlapping subjects. It happens all the time in media."

I can see Maya's breathing accelerate, her chest rising and falling too quickly as Avery's gaslighting continues. The moderator notices too and pivots again.

"Avery, you mentioned your intention was to raise awareness. Can you elaborate on why these stories felt important to share?"

Another softball question, giving Avery a platform to paint herself as a champion of social causes rather than addressing the actual theft.

"Of course," Avery says, relaxing into this familiar territory. "In today's digital landscape, so many people struggle silently with the pressures of online life. I wanted to create a space where those struggles could be acknowledged and validated." She turns to Maya with a practiced expression of empathy. "Including yours, Maya. Your story resonated with so many people because it's authentic. Your vulnerability was powerful."

I watch Maya's face as Avery co-opts her pain into a talking point. Her eyes widen slightly, her breathing becoming more erratic. She's starting to panic, and neither Avery nor the moderator seems to care—or worse, they notice and are deliberately pushing her toward a breaking point.

"Don't you think," Avery continues, leaning in closer, "that sharing your experience might help others who are suffering in silence? Isn't that worth some temporary discomfort?"

The question is breathtakingly manipulative, framing Maya's objections as selfish rather than legitimate. If she disagrees, she's denying help to others. If she agrees, she's undermining her own complaint.

"I... that's not..." Maya struggles to find solid ground as the trap closes around her. "Other people's healing isn't my responsibility. I get to decide how and when my story is shared."

"Of course," Avery says soothingly. "But don't you think that sharing vulnerability is a way of asking for connection? For witnesses to your experience?"

The question lands like a slap. Avery is subtly suggesting that Maya wanted attention all along—that her current objections are hypocritical.

"No, that's not—" Maya's voice catches. "I shared with Casey because I trusted her. I didn't ask for thousands of strangers to—to judge me, to comment on my life."

"Yet here you are," Avery points out gently, "participating in a public conversation about the very topic. Couldn't that suggest part of you does want to be heard more widely?"

It's a master class in manipulation. Avery has maneuvered Maya into a position where her very presence at this event can be used against her. I can see Maya's growing distress—her eyes darting around the auditorium, her hands now visibly trembling.

"I'm here because you gave me no choice," Maya says, her voice rising in pitch. "If I didn't come, you'd talk about me anyway. You'd control the whole narrative."

The moderator steps in. "Let's be mindful of keeping our tone constructive. Maya, it sounds like you felt pressured to participate today. Can you explain that feeling more calmly?"

The tone policing is the final straw. Maya stands abruptly, her chair scraping loudly against the stage floor.

"This is exactly what I mean!" Her voice cracks with emotion. "You invite me here pretending to care about my perspective, but you're really just using me for—for content. For engagement. You don't care how this affects me."

Avery remains seated, projecting calm concern in contrast to Maya's growing agitation. "Maya, I understand you're upset. But this kind of emotional reaction is exactly why these conversations are so difficult to have online. I was hoping we could model a more productive approach."

It's the perfect response to make Maya appear unstable while positioning Avery as the reasonable adult in the room. I can see the panic building in Maya's eyes as she realizes she's been outmaneuvered at every turn.

"This isn't a conversation," Maya says, her breathing now visibly labored. "This is—this is a performance. You're using me again, just like you used Casey's footage, just like you use everything and everyone for your—your brand."

The camera zooms in on Maya's face as she struggles to maintain composure. Tears well in her eyes, her chest heaving with the effort to breathe normally. It's excruciating to watch, knowing she's spiraling into a panic attack on a livestream viewed by hundreds, possibly thousands of people.

"I think we should take a short break," the moderator suggests, standing up. "Maya, would you like some water?"

But it's too late. Maya's panic has crossed the threshold into a full-blown attack. Her breathing comes in short, desperate gasps. Tears stream down her face. Her hands clutch at her sweater as if searching for an anchor in the storm of anxiety overtaking her.

"I can't—I can't breathe," she manages between gasps. "Everyone's watching—I can't—"

The audience murmurs in discomfort. The camera stays fixed on Maya's distress, capturing every second of her vulnerability. In the bottom corner of the screen, I can see the viewer count climbing—the algorithm boosting the stream as engagement spikes in response to the unfolding drama.

"Cut the camera," I hear Ms. Santos call from the audience. "Give her some privacy!"

But the livestream continues, the operators either unwilling or unable to stop broadcasting Maya's breakdown. Jordan and several other students stand up, moving toward the stage in an attempt to help, but a school security guard blocks their path.

Avery remains in her seat, her expression a perfect mask of concerned helplessness. She's neither helping Maya nor explicitly making things worse—just watching, letting the situation unfold in a way that inevitably casts her as the composed, mature party.

"I think we need to end the stream," the moderator finally says, moving to stand in front of Maya as if to shield her from the camera. "We'll continue this conversation another time, when—"

The stream abruptly cuts off, the screen freezing on a final image of Maya's tear-streaked face, eyes wide with panic, before switching to a generic "Technical Difficulties" message.

Silence fills Dex's storage unit as we stare at the screen. I feel physically ill, my stomach twisted in knots of horror and guilt. Maya's worst fear realized—a panic attack broadcast live to the entire school and beyond, her most vulnerable moment turned into public spectacle.

"That," Dex says quietly, "was the most calculated psychological takedown I've ever witnessed."

I can't speak, can't find words adequate to express the rage and helplessness churning inside me. Maya trusted me with her story. I promised to protect her. And now this.

"She planned the whole thing," Dex continues, his voice hardening. "Every question, every redirection, every sympathetic head tilt—all designed to push Maya toward exactly that reaction. It wasn't an accident. It was the goal."

"We have to help her," I finally manage, my voice barely audible. "She's going to be devastated."

"Help her how?" Dex swivels to face me. "The damage is done. That footage exists now. You can bet people are already clipping it, screenshot-ting it, turning it into whatever form will get the most engagement."

As if to confirm his prediction, my phone buzzes with a text from Jordan:

**Jordan:** It's already spreading. Clips of Maya's panic attack on TrendUp with captions. We're reporting as fast as we can but it's everywhere.

Attached is a screenshot of a TrendUp post—a 10-second clip of Maya's breakdown with the caption "me when my mom asks about my homework 😂." It already has thousands of views.

I show the screen to Dex, whose expression darkens further.

"And so it begins," he says grimly. "By tomorrow morning, Maya's panic attack will be a meme, a reaction GIF, a TikTok sound. The internet's newest piece of disposable cruelty."

The clinical accuracy of his prediction makes it all the more horrifying. I've seen it happen before—moments of real human suffering transformed into viral entertainment, context stripped away until all that remains is the spectacle of someone else's pain.

"This is my fault," I whisper, the weight of guilt crushing down on me. "If I hadn't pursued this fight with Avery, if I hadn't escalated with the article..."

"No." Dex's voice cuts through my spiral of self-blame. "This is on Avery. She stole your work. She targeted Maya. She orchestrated this entire situation specifically to create this outcome." His eyes are cold with fury. "And she's going to pay for it."

The venom in his voice should frighten me, but in this moment, it resonates with something dark and vengeful awakening inside me. Maya trusted me, and I failed to protect her. My attempts at fighting back through official channels were useless. Even our first strike with Dex—exposing Avery to Lumina—ultimately hurt Maya more than Avery.

"How?" I ask, my voice hollow. "How do we make her pay?"

Dex turns back to his monitors, fingers flying across the keyboard. "I've been developing options. Ways to hit Avery where it actually hurts. Not just her brand deals or her social reputation, but her future. Her college applications. Her family's standing."

The scope of what he's suggesting should horrify me. A week ago, it would have. But watching Maya break down on camera, knowing the viral humiliation that awaits her, has shifted something fundamental inside me.

"Show me," I say.

Dex glances at me, assessing the change in my tone. "You sure? Once we go down this road, there's no turning back."

My phone buzzes again—multiple notifications from different platforms. I don't need to look to know what they are. Maya's moment of vulnerability is already being weaponized, commodified, spread across the digital landscape like a virus. By morning, she won't be able to open any app without seeing herself at her worst, turned into a joke for strangers' entertainment.

"I'm sure," I say, a cold resolve settling in my chest. "Show me everything."

As Dex pulls up his plans, my mind returns to Maya's face on that livestream—the terror in her eyes, the helplessness, the complete exposure of her most private self. No one deserves that. No brand deal, no social clout, no strategic career advantage justifies what Avery did today.

The livestream was supposed to be Avery's masterpiece—the perfect PR move to rehabilitate her image while further undermining Maya. Instead, it will become the justification for whatever comes next. Whatever it takes to make sure Avery Liang never hurts anyone like this again.

The line between justice and vengeance has never felt thinner. And right now, I'm not sure I care which side I'm on anymore.

# CHAPTER 11

I don't sleep. How could I? Every time I close my eyes, I see Maya's face—eyes wide with panic, tears streaming down her cheeks, gasping for breath as hundreds of people watched live. I see the cold calculation in Avery's expression, the perfect mask of concern that never reached her eyes. I see the red notification counters ticking up on my phone, each one another piece of Maya's suffering turned into entertainment.

By morning, what I feared most has come true. Maya's breakdown isn't just a video anymore—it's a meme, a GIF, a reaction image shared across every platform. I scroll through TrendUp with numb horror, watching as her most vulnerable moment is stripped of context and transformed into something cruel:

"Me when the teacher collects homework I didn't do 😂"
"When your crush looks in your direction"
"Finals week be like..."

Each post has thousands of likes, hundreds of shares. Some have been remixed with music, with text overlays, with zoomed-in footage of Maya's panic-stricken face. The algorithm is promoting them aggressively—the perfect mix of dramatic emotion and cruel humor that drives engagement.

I throw my phone across the room, unable to look anymore. It bounces off my pillow and lands face-up on the floor, screen still illuminated with a freeze-frame of Maya mid-breakdown.

"Casey?" Mom knocks softly on my door. "You need to get up for school."

"I'm not going," I call back, my voice hoarse from a night of unshed tears.

There's a pause, then the sound of the door opening. Mom stands in the doorway, already dressed in her Solas cafeteria uniform, her expression tight with concern.

"You can't hide from this," she says gently.

"I'm not hiding." The lie tastes bitter. "I just can't face it today."

Mom sighs and crosses the room, picking up my discarded phone. She glances at the screen, her face darkening as she sees what I've been looking at.

"Oh, Maya," she murmurs, then looks at me. "Have you talked to her?"

I shake my head. "She's not answering texts. Her mom says she locked herself in her room."

"This is..." Mom struggles for words, gesturing at the phone. "This is cruel. Why would people do this?"

"Because they can," I say flatly. "Because it gets likes. Because the algorithm rewards it."

Mom sits on the edge of my bed, her uniform crinkling slightly. She looks tired, the kind of bone-deep exhaustion that comes from watching your child suffer and being unable to fix it.

"I have to work a double shift today," she says. "But I can call in sick if you need me to stay."

"No." I sit up, forcing myself to sound more together than I feel. "We can't afford that. I'll be okay."

"Will you?" She searches my face. "Because you don't look okay, Casey. You look like someone planning something dangerous."

Her perception startles me. Has my face already begun to reflect the cold resolve I felt last night in Dex's storage unit? The decision to do whatever it takes to make Avery pay?

"I'm just worried about Maya," I say, which is at least partly true.

Mom doesn't look convinced, but she nods and stands up. "I left breakfast on the counter. Promise me you'll eat something, at least?"

"I promise."

After she leaves, I force myself to retrieve my phone and check my messages. Nothing from Maya, but several from Jordan:

**Jordan:** The memes are everywhere. Debuggers reported hundreds of posts overnight but they keep popping up faster than we can handle.

**Jordan:** School administration finally sent an email asking students to stop sharing the clips. Too little, too late.

**Jordan:** Maya's not responding to anyone. Her parents called the school to say she won't be coming in for the foreseeable future.

**Jordan:** Let me know if you're coming to school today. We're organizing a support campaign for Maya. Nothing will undo this but we're trying to counter the narrative.

The last text was sent just fifteen minutes ago. I hesitate, then reply:

**Me:** Not coming in. Can't face it. What kind of support campaign?

His response is almost immediate:

**Jordan:** We're asking people to post positive memories or messages for Maya using #WeStandWithMaya. Trying to drown out the memes with actual support.

**Jordan:** Also documenting every instance of the meme for potential harassment reports.

I stare at his message, a lump forming in my throat. Jordan and the Debuggers are actively doing something constructive, while I spent the night fantasizing about revenge. The contrast makes me feel small and petty.

**Me:** That's really good of you. Let me know if I can help.

**Jordan:** Just take care of yourself. This isn't your fault.

But it is my fault. Maybe not entirely, but significantly. I knew the livestream was a trap. I knew Avery was planning to humiliate Maya. And yet I let it happen, watched from the safety of Dex's hideout while my best friend was destroyed on camera.

I drag myself out of bed and try to eat the breakfast Mom left, but each bite sticks in my throat. After managing a few mouthfuls, I give up and return to my room, where I spend the next hour trying to reach Maya through every possible channel. Text, call, social media—all met with silence.

Finally, I call her house. Mrs. Restrepo answers, her voice hollow with exhaustion.

"Casey." Just my name, no greeting.

"Mrs. Restrepo, please. I need to talk to Maya."

"She's not talking to anyone right now." The weariness in her voice cuts through me. "She hasn't left her room since last night. She won't eat. She just lies there with the covers over her head."

"Can I come over? Maybe if I'm there in person—"

"I don't think that's a good idea." The gentle rejection feels like a slap. "She's... she's not in a good place, Casey. She needs time."

"Please tell her I'm thinking about her," I say, my voice cracking. "Tell her I'm sorry."

"I'll tell her." Mrs. Restrepo pauses, then adds softly, "This isn't what you wanted. I know that. But Casey... I think it would be best if you gave Maya some space right now."

The call ends, leaving me with the distinct sensation of another door closing, another connection severed. Maya needs space from me—from the person who was supposed to protect her, who instead led her into disaster.

My phone buzzes with a text from Dex:

**Dex:** Meeting today? We need to move fast while this is still hot.

The cold, tactical phrasing makes my skin crawl. Last night, in the heat of my anger, his approach seemed justified. In the harsh light of morning, with Maya suffering in silence, it feels exploitative.

**Me:** Not today. I need to think.

**Dex:** Thinking won't fix this. Action will.

I don't respond, unable to find words for the conflict churning inside me. Instead, I open social media again, masochistically scrolling through the continued spread of Maya's meme. It's everywhere now—not just on teenage platforms like TrendUp, but across the broader internet. Major meme accounts with millions of followers have picked it up, stripping away any remaining context until Maya is just a face, just a reaction, just content to be consumed and discarded.

The comments are worst of all:

"Who is this girl? She's having a complete meltdown 😂"
"Someone needs to take her anxiety meds lmao"
"I can't stop watching this, her face when she realizes everyone's staring at her 💀"

I force myself to keep reading, to witness what Maya is facing, what she'll continue to face for days, weeks, possibly months to come. This isn't something that will blow over quickly. The internet has latched onto her pain, finding it endlessly entertaining.

A notification pops up—a direct message from someone I don't know:

**Unknown:** is this you in the video with the panicking girl? you're the one who started all this drama right?

Attached is a screenshot from the livestream, a frame that briefly captured my documentary footage playing on the screen behind Avery. The message is a stark reminder that I'm not invisible in this story. As the meme spreads further from its source, people are beginning to ask questions, to look for context, to find the other players in this drama.

I don't respond to the message, but it triggers a new wave of anxiety. How long before this spreads beyond North Point High? Before local news picks it up? Before Maya's panic attack becomes not just a meme, but a cautionary tale discussed on daytime television by people who know nothing about her or what led to this moment?

The thought is so overwhelming I have to put my phone down again, pressing the heels of my hands against my eyes until I see stars. This can't be happening. This can't be real.

But it is. And somewhere across town, Maya is experiencing it a thousand times more intensely, watching herself become a punchline in real time, unable to escape the infinite copies of her worst moment.

I pick up my phone again and navigate to InstaFrame, dreading what I'll find on Avery's profile. Sure enough, she's posted a solemn, black-and-white photo with a carefully worded caption:

"My heart goes out to Maya during this difficult time. Mental health struggles are real and deserve our compassion, not our judgment. I never intended for yesterday's conversation to cause distress, and I'm devastated that it ended the way it did. Let's all remember the real human beings behind our screens. #BeKind #MentalHealthAwareness"

The performance of empathy is so precise, so calculated, it makes me physically ill. Avery has managed to position herself as a concerned advocate, conveniently sidestepping her role in orchestrating the very situation that led to Maya's breakdown.

Worse still, the comments are overwhelmingly supportive:

"You handled this so gracefully, Avery! Not your fault she couldn't keep it together."
"Such a queen for using your platform to raise awareness 👑"
"Don't blame yourself! You were just trying to have an important conversation."

I close the app, unable to stomach any more of Avery's skillful narrative manipulation. She's not just escaping consequences—she's benefiting from this disaster, gaining sympathy and praise while Maya's life crumbles.

My room suddenly feels too small, the walls closing in around me. I need air, space, a moment away from screens and notifications and the constant reminder of my failure. I throw on clothes without really seeing what I'm grabbing, pull my hair into a messy ponytail, and slip out the front door before I can think better of it.

The morning is unseasonably cool, a thin fog hanging over Meridian Bay like a shroud. I walk without purpose, just needing to move, to feel something beyond the sickening guilt that's settled in my stomach. My feet carry me automatically toward Maya's neighborhood, then stop abruptly when I realize where I'm heading. Mrs. Restrepo's words echo in my head: "I think it would be best if you gave Maya some space right now."

I turn away, changing course toward the bay instead. The path along the water is nearly empty at this hour, most people already at work or school. The quietness should be peaceful, but it only amplifies the chaos in my mind.

My phone buzzes in my pocket. Against my better judgment, I check it—another message from Jordan:

**Jordan:** Principal Davis just called an emergency assembly about "online behavior and digital citizenship." Classic case of closing the barn door after the horse has bolted. Thought you'd want to know.

I can picture it so clearly—the hollow, meaningless assembly where adults who don't understand what's happening will lecture teenagers about "thinking before posting" without addressing the systemic issues that make cruel content so rewarding to create and share. They'll treat this as an isolated incident of bad behavior rather than a feature of the system working exactly as designed.

**Me:** Let me guess. No specific mention of Maya or what happened to her. Just generic warnings about being careful online.

**Jordan:** Exactly. And no consequences for Avery at all. She's sitting in the front row looking appropriately solemn.

Of course she is. Avery knows exactly how to perform the role of concerned citizen while escaping any actual accountability. The school is complicit in this performance, too afraid of the Liang family's influence to name what really happened.

I put my phone away and continue walking, the fog growing thicker around me. It feels appropriate somehow—this physical manifestation of the moral murkiness I'm wading through. There are no clear paths forward, no obvious right answers. Just fog in every direction.

When I finally return home, hours later, I force myself to check social media again. The Maya meme continues to spread, now with variations and remixes. Someone has set her panic attack to dramatic music from a movie soundtrack. Another has edited it into reaction GIFs for different situations. A third has created a split-screen comparison between Maya and a crying cat.

Each new permutation feels like another betrayal, another failure on my part to protect her. I should be able to stop this somehow. I should be able to make it right.

My phone rings—an actual call, not a text. It's Dex.

"What?" I answer, not bothering to hide my exhaustion.

"Have you seen TrendUp in the last hour?" he asks without preamble.

"No. I can't stomach any more memes."

"It's not just memes anymore. Someone's created a TrendUp sound using the audio from Maya's panic attack. It's being used for transition effects, for dance videos, for comedy skits. It's gone beyond North Point High. It's spreading to users who have no idea who Maya is or what they're actually laughing at."

The revelation hits me like a physical blow. I hadn't considered this possibility—that Maya's suffering would be decontextualized to the point of becoming just another piece of audio to remix and repurpose. The violation feels even more profound somehow.

"How do we stop it?" I ask, desperation creeping into my voice.

"We can't," Dex says bluntly. "That's not how viral content works. Once it's out there, it's out there. The best we can do now is make someone pay for starting it."

"Avery," I say, the name feeling like poison on my tongue.

"Avery," he confirms. "I have everything we need. Just say the word."

I hesitate, torn between the visceral desire for revenge and the nagging awareness that escalation hasn't helped so far—has, in fact, made things worse at every turn.

"I need to check on Maya first," I decide. "See how bad it really is."

"It's bad, Casey. Worse than you're imagining. But suit yourself. Let me know when you're ready to actually do something about it."

The call ends, leaving me with the distinct impression that Dex's patience is wearing thin. He wants action, retribution, a target for his considerable skills. The longer I hesitate, the more likely he is to move forward without me—or to withdraw his help entirely.

I try calling Maya again, unsurprised when it goes straight to voicemail. Then I text Mrs. Restrepo, keeping it simple:

**Me:** Just checking in. How is she today?

The response takes almost an hour to arrive:

**Mrs. Restrepo:** Not good. She won't look at her phone but knows what's happening. A classmate sent her a compilation of the memes. She's destroyed.

The stark assessment lands like a blow. Maya is "destroyed"—no qualification, no softening. Just brutal reality.

**Me:** Is there anything I can do?

**Mrs. Restrepo:** I don't think so. Not right now. She needs professional help. We're looking into options.

Professional help. The situation has escalated beyond what friendship can address, beyond what apologies can fix. Maya needs a therapist, possibly medication, a safe space away from the relentless cruelty of the internet.

And what do I need? What could possibly help me navigate this nightmare I've helped create?

I spend the rest of the day in a fog, moving between my bed and my desk without purpose. I try to work on homework, on college applications, on anything that might provide a sense of normalcy, but nothing holds my attention. All I can think about is Maya, alone in her room, knowing that thousands of strangers are laughing at her most vulnerable moment.

By evening, the meme has evolved again. Now there are side-by-side comparisons of Maya with other viral "freakout" videos. There are parodies where people fake similar panic attacks. There are even merchandise listings—t-shirts and mugs featuring stylized versions of her distressed face.

The commodification of her pain is so complete, so ruthlessly efficient, that it leaves me breathless. This is what my documentary was meant to expose—the way the internet turns real human experiences into content to be consumed, how algorithms reward the most sensationalist and cruel iterations, how quickly context is stripped away until nothing remains but the spectacle.

But knowing about the system, even documenting it, has done nothing to protect us from it. If anything, my attempts to fight back have only fed the beast, giving it more drama, more conflict, more emotionally charged content to monetize.

The realization sits heavy in my chest as I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling. I've been fighting the wrong battle all along. I've been so focused on Avery—on revenge, on justice, on making her pay—that I've lost sight of what actually matters: protecting Maya, finishing my documentary, exposing the broken system that makes all of this possible.

I've been playing directly into that system's hands, generating more conflict, more engagement, more viral moments. And Maya is paying the price.

My phone buzzes one last time before I fall into an exhausted sleep. It's Jordan again:

**Jordan:** Just wanted you to know the Debuggers are still fighting. We've gotten about 300 posts taken down today for harassment. It's not enough, but it's something. #WeStandWithMaya is starting to gain traction too. There's still good out there, Casey. Don't forget that.

His message is a small pinpoint of light in the darkness—a reminder that not everyone is participating in the cruelty, that some people are actively working against it. It's not enough to stem the tide of a viral meme, but it's something. A signal through the noise.

I fall asleep with my phone clutched in my hand, Jordan's message still illuminating the screen. In my dreams, I see Maya's face—not panicked and crying as on the livestream, but smiling, creating art, being herself before all of this began. Before I dragged her into a war she never asked to fight.

When I wake hours later, my pillow is wet with tears I don't remember crying. And my resolve is hardened into something new—not the vengeful fury of last night, but a clear-eyed determination to find a way forward that doesn't feed the very system I set out to critique.

I need to help Maya. I need to finish my documentary. I need to expose what's really happening here.

And I need to decide, once and for all, whether Dex's methods will help achieve those goals—or just create more casualties in a war that has already claimed too much.

# Chapter 12

# CHAPTER 12

Mom works a double shift again the next day. I lie to her, tell her I'm going to school. Instead, I wait until she leaves, then curl back under the covers, my phone face-down on the nightstand. I can't bear to look at the notifications, can't stomach another evolution of Maya's suffering transformed into entertainment.

But the silence is almost worse. My imagination fills in the gaps, conjuring new horrors: Maya's panic attack remixed with pop songs, animated GIFs zooming in on her tears, reaction videos of strangers laughing at her breakdown. Each imagined iteration feels like a fresh betrayal.

Eventually, the need to know overwhelms me. I reach for my phone like an addict, hating myself even as I unlock the screen.

The notifications have multiplied overnight. Messages from classmates I barely speak to, asking if I've "seen what happened to Maya." Comments on my old posts tagging me, demanding to know my role in the "drama." A few sympathetic texts from Jordan and the Debuggers, updating me on their ongoing battle against the spread.

But nothing from Maya.

I open TrendUp, bracing myself. The app takes longer than usual to load—a sign of high engagement with whatever's trending. When it finally opens, my stomach drops.

"Maya Meltdown" is the top trending sound. Users across the country, across the world, are using the audio of my best friend's panic attack as a backdrop for comedy skits, transition effects, even dance videos. Most have no idea who Maya is or where the sound originated. They've just seen others using it and joined in, thoughtlessly participating in the mockery of a stranger's worst moment.

One video has over three million views: a teenage girl lipsyncing to Maya's gasping breaths, exaggerating the panic, playing it for laughs as she pretends to hyperventilate over a bad test grade. The comments are a cesspool of cry-laughing emojis and variations of "this is so me."

I force myself to keep scrolling, to witness what Maya is facing. Someone has created merchandise—t-shirts printed with a stylized image of Maya's tear-streaked face and the caption "I Can't Breathe." A popular gamer uses the audio as a reaction when he loses a match. A makeup artist demonstrates a "tear-proof look" with Maya's breakdown playing in the background.

The decontextualization is complete. Maya isn't a person anymore—she's content, a trend, a sound, a meme. Her identity has been stripped away, leaving only her suffering for public consumption.

I throw my phone down again, bile rising in my throat. This is worse than I imagined, worse than anything I prepared for when I started my documentary. This is what digital cruelty really looks like: not just targeted harassment, but the casual, mindless amplification of someone's pain for entertainment.

My phone buzzes again. Dex.

**Dex:** Still waiting on your decision. This is only going to get worse.

He's right. Without intervention, this will continue to spread, to evolve, to find new and creative ways to exploit Maya's vulnerability. And Avery—the architect of this disaster—will face no consequences. She'll continue to post her sympathetic black-and-white photos, building her brand on the ruins of Maya's dignity.

I think about the documentary—my original purpose before all of this. I wanted to expose how the system silences certain voices while amplifying others. I wanted to show the invisible barriers that determine whose stories matter.

But I've become so focused on fighting Avery that I've lost sight of that purpose. I've been feeding the very system I set out to critique, generating more conflict, more viral moments, more engagement.

And Maya is paying the price.

**Me:** What exactly are you proposing?

Dex's response is immediate:

**Dex:** Three options. 1) Expose Avery's entire digital life—personal messages, search history, drafts. Everything. 2) Target her college applications with evidence of her theft and manipulation. 3) Go after her family—her father's business dealings aren't as clean as they appear.

The options make my skin crawl. Not because they wouldn't be effective—they would—but because they represent exactly the kind of digital violation that's destroying Maya right now. Fighting fire with fire might burn Avery, but it would also spread the flames.

**Me:** I don't know if any of those are right.

**Dex:** Then what IS right, Casey? Doing nothing? Letting her win?

Before I can respond, my phone rings. Unknown number. I almost ignore it, but something—instinct, maybe—tells me to answer.

"Hello?"

"Casey." The voice is barely recognizable—Mrs. Restrepo, but drained of all energy. "I need you to come over. Right now."

My heart stops. "Is Maya okay?"

A long pause. "No. She's not. Please, just come."

The call ends before I can ask anything more. My hands shake as I pull on clothes, grab my keys, and rush out the door. My mind races with possibilities, each worse than the last. Has Maya hurt herself? Is she in the hospital? Has something new happened online to escalate the situation?

I break into a run, the ten blocks to Maya's house stretching endlessly before me. By the time I arrive, sweating and breathless, my heart is pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat.

Mrs. Restrepo opens the door before I can knock. Her eyes are red-rimmed, her usually neat appearance disheveled. "Thank you for coming," she says, her voice hollow. "She's upstairs."

"What happened?" I ask, following her inside.

Mrs. Restrepo stops at the foot of the stairs, her shoulders slumping. "She won't eat. Won't speak to us. Won't come out of her room except to use the bathroom when she thinks we're asleep." She turns to me, her eyes filled with tears. "We found her this morning... she'd deleted all of her art. Everything. Years of work. She said she was 'erasing herself before they could.'"

The words hit me like a physical blow. Maya's art is everything to her—her voice, her passion, her future. Deleting it is an act of such profound desperation that it takes my breath away.

"Where's Mr. Restrepo?" I ask, looking around the unusually quiet house.

"Taking Santiago to my sister's." Maya's younger brother. "We thought it would be better if he wasn't here right now. He doesn't understand what's happening, just that Maya is..." She trails off.

"Can I see her?"

Mrs. Restrepo hesitates. "She said she didn't want to see anyone. But I'm afraid, Casey. I'm afraid of what she might do if she keeps spiraling like this." She steps closer, lowering her voice. "The therapist can't see her until next week. The school counselor offered a video call, but she refuses. I don't know what else to do."

The naked fear in her voice settles like ice in my stomach. This isn't just a bad day or a temporary crisis. This is Maya in freefall, her entire sense of self unraveling in real time.

"I'll try," I promise, though I have no idea what I could possibly say to make this better.

Mrs. Restrepo nods gratefully. "I'll be downstairs if you need me."

I climb the stairs slowly, each step heavier than the last. Outside Maya's door, I pause, listening. Silence. Not even the rustle of movement. I knock softly.

"Maya? It's Casey."

Nothing.

"Maya, please. Just let me know you're okay."

Silence stretches between us, long enough that I wonder if she's somehow slipped out without anyone noticing. Then, finally, a muffled response:

"I'm not okay."

The admission—so simple, so devastating in its honesty—breaks something inside me. "Can I come in? Please?"

More silence, then the soft sound of movement. The lock clicks, and the door opens just enough for me to see a sliver of Maya's face. She looks like a ghost—pale, hollow-eyed, her hair unwashed and tangled around her shoulders.

"Five minutes," she says, her voice a rasp. "Then you have to go."

I slip inside, and she immediately retreats to her bed, pulling the covers up to her chin like armor. Her room is even more barren than the last time I visited. Not just the art removed from the walls, but everything personal stripped away—photos, books, mementos, all gone. The only things remaining are her furniture and a small trash can overflowing with crumpled tissues.

"Your mom said you deleted your art," I say quietly, perching on the edge of her desk chair.

Maya stares at the ceiling. "What's the point of keeping it? So more people can steal it? Turn it into a joke?"

"No one's going to—"

"You don't know that." Her eyes flash briefly with anger, the first real emotion I've seen from her. "You can't promise anything. You couldn't stop Avery from stealing your work. You couldn't stop her from using me for content. You can't stop any of this."

The accusation lands like a slap, but I can't argue. She's right. I've been powerless at every turn, my attempts at fighting back only making things worse.

"I'm sorry," I whisper, the words wholly inadequate.

Maya turns away, facing the wall. "Everyone's sorry. That doesn't make the videos disappear. That doesn't stop strangers from turning me into a meme. That doesn't fix anything."

"What can I do?" I ask, desperation bleeding into my voice. "Tell me what you need, Maya. Anything."

"I need it to stop." Her voice cracks. "I need to not exist online anymore. I need everyone to forget what happened. I need to go back in time and never agree to be in your stupid documentary."

Each word is a knife, precisely aimed at my deepest guilt. "I never should have asked you. I never should have filmed you."

"No, you shouldn't have." She pulls the blanket tighter around herself. "But it's too late now."

The finality in her tone terrifies me. "Maya, this will pass. It feels impossible right now, but people will move on to the next viral thing. They always do."

"And what am I supposed to do until then?" She sits up suddenly, her eyes wild. "Hide in my room forever? Change my name? Move to another country? The internet doesn't forget, Casey. This follows me forever. Any college I apply to, any job I interview for, any person I date—they can find this with one search. I'm the panic attack girl now. That's all I'll ever be."

Her words hang in the air between us, their brutal truth undeniable. The internet's memory is long, its archive vast and searchable. Even if the active mockery dies down, the digital record remains.

"We'll figure something out," I say weakly.

"There's nothing to figure out." Maya lies back down, turning away again. "Just go, Casey. Your five minutes are up."

"I'm not leaving you like this."

"Like what?" Her laugh is hollow, chilling. "I'm fine. I'm just tired." She pulls the covers over her head. "Please go. I want to sleep."

The dismissal is absolute, her body language screaming for solitude. I stand reluctantly, knowing that pushing harder will only drive her further away.

"I'll come back tomorrow," I promise.

No response.

At the door, I pause. "I love you, Maya. You're more than this moment. You're more than what they're doing to you."

A small sound escapes from under the blanket—not quite a sob, but close. I wait, hoping for more, but she remains silent and still. Eventually, I slip out, closing the door softly behind me.

Mrs. Restrepo is waiting at the bottom of the stairs, her face a question.

"She talked a little," I report. "But she's... it's bad."

Mrs. Restrepo nods, her shoulders slumping further. "The school called earlier. The principal wanted to check on her, offered 'resources.'" Her mouth twists bitterly. "Where were these resources when that girl was planning her ambush? Where were they when the harassment started?"

The same questions I've been asking myself. Where was the system when we needed it? Where were the protections that should have prevented this?

"I'm so sorry," I say again, the phrase becoming a hollow refrain. "If there's anything I can do..."

"Just keep trying with her," Mrs. Restrepo says. "She listens to you. Or she used to."

The past tense cuts deep. Used to. Before I dragged her into a war with Avery. Before I failed to protect her. Before everything fell apart.

I leave with a heaviness in my chest that makes it hard to breathe. The short walk home feels endless, each step weighed down by the image of Maya in her stripped-bare room, systematically erasing herself from the digital world that's turned against her.

My phone buzzes constantly—Dex, still waiting for my decision. Jordan, updating me on the Debuggers' efforts. Classmates, gossip-hungry and insensitive. I ignore them all, too numb to engage.

At home, I lock myself in my room and open my laptop. Not to check social media or read messages, but to look at my documentary footage—the original project that started all of this. I find the raw interview with Maya, filmed in her bedroom before Avery stole it, before everything spiraled out of control.

On screen, Maya sits cross-legged on her bed, surrounded by her artwork. She's animated, passionate as she explains why she stopped posting online.

"It wasn't worth the comments," she says, gesturing to a particularly vibrant digital painting. "I'd spend hours on a piece, pour my heart into it, and then some random person would write 'kill yourself' and get twenty-seven likes. And suddenly that became the conversation. Not the art. Not what I was trying to say. Just the cruelty."

I pause the video, studying her face. The Maya on my screen is so different from the hollow-eyed ghost I just left—alive with emotion, eyes bright with purpose despite the pain she's describing. This was the real Maya. This was who she was before Avery, before the livestream, before the meme.

I press play again.

"The worst part is how the platforms reward it," Maya continues. "The algorithm pushes controversial content, emotional content. So the post with the cruel comment gets more engagement, which means more people see it, which means more cruel comments, and suddenly that's all anyone associates with your work."

She leans forward, her expression intensifying. "That's why I stopped posting. Not because I stopped creating, but because I refused to feed a system designed to monetize pain. I decided my art was for me first. For people who actually care about it, not for strangers looking for something to tear apart."

I stop the video again, her words resonating more powerfully now than when I first recorded them. Maya understood the system perfectly. She saw the trap and opted out, choosing to protect her creativity from the digital machine that would exploit and distort it.

And then I convinced her to participate in my documentary. I promised it would be different, that her story would help others, that I would protect her.

I failed on every count.

My phone buzzes again—Dex, growing impatient:

**Dex:** I need an answer, Casey. Are we doing this or not?

This time, I respond:

**Me:** What you're suggesting is exactly what's happening to Maya right now. Digital violation. Public humiliation. The weaponization of private moments.

**Dex:** Avery deserves it. Maya didn't.

**Me:** Maybe. But becoming like Avery isn't the answer.

**Dex:** Then what is? Because while you're having this moral crisis, Maya is suffering and Avery is getting away with it.

He's right about one thing: Maya is suffering. Intensely, devastatingly. And Avery is indeed getting away with it, her reputation intact, her brand possibly even strengthened by her performance of concern.

But Dex is wrong about the solution. Fighting the system from within the system's rules only reinforces those rules. It generates more conflict, more engagement, more viral moments—feeding the very machine that's destroying Maya.

I need to find another way. A way that doesn't play by the system's rules. A way that exposes the truth without creating more casualties.

I turn back to my documentary footage, scrolling through clips I haven't watched in weeks. Maya talking about digital anxiety. Jordan discussing algorithmic bias. A sophomore explaining how social media companies profit from outrage and controversy.

And then I find it—an interview I'd almost forgotten. Ms. Santos, speaking not as my teacher but as a former journalist:

"The most powerful thing you can do in a world of noise is to create a clear signal. Not by shouting louder, but by cutting through the distortion with truth. With context. With the human story behind the sensationalism."

A clear signal. Not more noise.

I think about Maya's art, deleted in a moment of despair. I think about my documentary, interrupted by Avery's theft. I think about all the voices silenced by a system that rewards the loudest, cruelest, most sensational content.

And slowly, a different path begins to take shape in my mind.

Not Dex's path of destructive revenge. Not passive acceptance of a broken system. Something else—something that could honor Maya's pain while exposing the truth about what happened. Something that could turn this disaster into the very exposé my documentary was meant to be.

I pull out my camera for the first time since this nightmare began. The weight of it in my hands feels both familiar and strange, like greeting an old friend who's changed in your absence. I set it up on my desk, adjust the frame, and press record.

"My name is Casey Morales," I say, looking directly into the lens. "And this is what happens when the system decides whose voices matter."

My voice shakes, but I keep going, the words pouring out with unexpected clarity. This is the real story—not just about Avery's theft, but about everything that followed. About platforms that reward cruelty. About algorithms that amplify pain. About the human cost of viral entertainment.

When I finish recording, I sit back, exhausted but somehow lighter. This won't fix everything. It won't erase the memes or heal Maya overnight. It might not even stop Avery.

But it's a start. A signal through the noise.

I reach for my phone and text Jordan:

**Me:** I need your help. Not with revenge. With something better.

His response comes quickly:

**Jordan:** I'm listening.

**Me:** I want to finish my documentary. Not just about digital inequality anymore. About what happened to Maya. About what's still happening. About the whole broken system.

**Jordan:** The Debuggers are in. What do you need from us?

For the first time in days, I feel a flicker of hope—not the dark satisfaction of plotting revenge, but something cleaner, more purposeful. A path forward that doesn't require becoming what I hate.

I glance at Dex's unanswered message, knowing he'll be angry, knowing I might lose his help forever. But as I look at the camera, at the beginning of something true, I realize I don't need his kind of help anymore.

What I need now is clarity. Purpose. A way to tell this story that matters.

What I need is to find my signal again.

# Chapter 13

# CHAPTER 13

The first sign that something has shifted comes when I wake to my phone ringing at 6:17 AM. It's Jordan.

"Casey, you need to see this."

His voice pulls me fully awake. "What's happened?"

"The audio from Maya's panic attack—it's being used as a transition sound on morning radio. Z103, the one all the parents listen to. The hosts are laughing about it."

I sit up, stomach twisting. "You're kidding."

"I wish I was. My mom had it on while making breakfast. They're playing it between segments, calling it the 'teenage meltdown' sound."

The violation feels exponential—expanding from teenage social media to mainstream radio, from digital spaces to the physical world. No longer contained to platforms Maya could avoid, but bleeding into everyday life.

"That's..." Words fail me.

"I know," Jordan says quietly. "The Debuggers are organizing a call-in campaign to the station, but..." He doesn't finish the sentence. We both know it's too late. The meme has escaped the bounds of teenage social media, entering the broader cultural conversation.

"How many people even know it's Maya?" I ask, a small, desperate hope forming that at least her identity might remain somewhat protected.

"Not many outside school, but that's changing too. Some news blog posted an article about 'Panic Attack Girl' going viral, mentioning it happened at a high school in Northern California. They didn't name her, but they included screenshots."

I close my eyes, imagining the widening circles of exposure. First North Point High, then social media, now radio and news sites. Each iteration strips more context, treats Maya's suffering more casually, reaches more people who see her not as a person but as content to be consumed.

"I'll call you back," I say, ending the call before Jordan can respond.

I try Maya first, unsurprised when it goes straight to voicemail. Then Mrs. Restrepo, who answers on the fourth ring, her voice heavy with exhaustion.

"Casey. It's early."

"I know, I'm sorry. I just heard about the radio station. Is Maya...?"

A long pause. "She heard it. Someone sent her the clip."

The cruelty is breathtaking—seeking Maya out to make sure she knows about each new humiliation. Not content to mock her, they need her to witness it.

"Can I come over? I need to talk to her."

"Not now, Casey." Mrs. Restrepo's voice is gentle but firm. "She's not in a good place."

"That's why I want to help. I have an idea, a way to maybe—"

"No more ideas," she interrupts. "No more fighting back or exposing truth or whatever you're planning. She needs peace, not another battle."

The rejection stings, even though I understand it. In Mrs. Restrepo's eyes, I'm part of the problem—the one who involved Maya in this mess in the first place.

"Will you at least tell her I called? That I'm thinking about her?"

"Of course." Her tone softens slightly. "Casey, I know you care about her. But right now, the best thing you can do is give her space."

After we hang up, I sit on the edge of my bed, staring at the wall. Space. Everyone keeps telling me to give Maya space. But space feels dangerous right now—space for her thoughts to spiral, for the online cruelty to echo unchallenged, for despair to deepen into something worse.

My phone buzzes with a text from Dex:

**Dex:** Since you've apparently decided moral superiority is more important than actual results, I'm moving forward on my own. Don't try to stop me.

A chill runs through me. Dex going rogue could mean anything—hacking Avery's accounts, exposing her private information, targeting her family. His version of justice is scorched earth, consequences be damned.

**Me:** Wait. What are you planning?

**Dex:** Why should I tell you? You've made it clear you don't have the stomach for what needs to be done.

**Me:** Because whatever you do affects Maya too. This isn't just about Avery.

No response. I wait five minutes, then try again:

**Me:** At least meet with me before you do anything. One conversation.

The reply takes so long I almost think he's ignoring me. Finally:

**Dex:** Fine. The Node. 4 PM. This is your last chance to stop playing by their rules.

Relief washes over me, followed immediately by dread. I have no idea how to convince Dex to stand down, especially when part of me still wants Avery to face consequences. The easy path would be to let him do whatever he's planning, to pretend I tried to stop him while secretly enjoying Avery's downfall.

But that path leads somewhere dark—somewhere I'm not sure I'd find my way back from.

---

Mom is already gone when I emerge from my room, off to another early shift at Solas. She's left breakfast and a note:

*Going to try to be home by 7 tonight. School called about your absences. We need to talk. Love you. -Mom*

The school. In the chaos of everything else, I'd almost forgotten about official consequences—attendance policies, missed assignments, concerned administrators. Another system demanding my attention while the real crisis unfolds beyond their reach.

I send Mom a quick text promising to be home for dinner, then check the time: 7:30 AM. Hours before my meeting with Dex, a full school day stretching before me. The thought of returning to North Point High turns my stomach—facing the whispers, the stares, the teachers who'll want explanations for my absence.

But hiding isn't an option anymore. If I'm going to finish my documentary, if I'm going to create something that matters, I need to face what's happening head-on.

I shower quickly, throw on clean clothes, and head out, determinedly not checking social media. Whatever new evolution of Maya's meme is circulating this morning, I don't want to see it before I have to.

The walk to school feels surreal, the ordinary world continuing around me—people commuting to work, sprinklers watering lawns, birds calling to each other—while my internal landscape is a battlefield. How can everything look so normal when Maya is falling apart? When our digital lives have become a war zone?

North Point High looms ahead, its modern glass entrance reflecting the morning sun. I pause at the edge of the property, steeling myself for what's inside. Then, straightening my shoulders, I walk through the doors.

The immediate silence is more telling than whispers would have been. Conversations halt as I pass, resuming in hushed tones once I'm a few steps away. Eyes follow me down the hallway—some curious, some pitying, a few openly hostile. I keep my gaze forward, refusing to acknowledge the attention.

At my locker, I find Jordan waiting, his expression a mix of concern and relief.

"You came," he says simply.

"Couldn't hide forever." I spin the combination lock with more force than necessary. "How bad is it in there?"

"Mixed," he admits. "Some people think what happened to Maya is awful. Others think it's hilarious. The teachers are trying to discourage discussion, which is basically the worst possible approach."

"And Avery?"

"Playing the concerned advocate. She did a morning announcement about 'digital citizenship' and 'online kindness.' Standing ovation from the administration."

The hypocrisy is so vast it's almost impressive. Avery orchestrates Maya's public humiliation, then positions herself as the solution to the problem she created.

"Classic," I mutter, shoving books into my backpack. "Any word on Maya?"

"Official story is she's out with 'health issues.' Unofficially, everyone knows." Jordan hesitates. "Casey, the Debuggers met last night about your documentary idea. We want to help, but we need to know what you're envisioning exactly."

I close my locker, turning to face him directly. "I want to finish what I started—a documentary about digital inequality. But now it's not theoretical. It's Maya's story. It's what happened when Avery stole my footage, when the platforms ignored our reports, when the school looked the other way." I lower my voice. "It's about a system that rewards cruelty and punishes vulnerability."

Jordan nods slowly. "That's bigger than just Avery."

"Exactly. Avery's part of it, but she's not the whole story. She's just exploiting a system that's designed to reward what she does."

The warning bell rings, sending students scurrying toward classrooms. Jordan and I remain still, the moment suspended between us.

"The Debuggers are in," he says finally. "Whatever you need. But Casey—" he meets my eyes directly "—are you sure this is the right approach? For Maya, I mean. More attention on what happened..."

The question hits a nerve because I've been asking myself the same thing. Is this what Maya needs? Or is it what I need—a way to channel my guilt and anger into something productive?

"I don't know," I admit. "But doing nothing isn't an option. And revenge isn't the answer. This feels like the only path forward that might actually make a difference."

Jordan studies my face for a long moment, then nods. "Okay. We're with you." He adjusts his backpack, preparing to head to class. "Meet at lunch? We can start planning."

The second bell rings as I nod, officially marking me late. One more small rebellion against a system that seems increasingly irrelevant to the real crisis unfolding in our lives.

---

First period is English, where we're discussing "The Great Gatsby"—a story about wealth, appearances, and the hollowness behind carefully constructed façades. The irony isn't lost on me as Ms. Palmer speaks about Gatsby's "elaborate performance" of success.

"What Fitzgerald shows us," she says, pacing at the front of the room, "is how social systems reward certain narratives while punishing others. Gatsby manufactures an acceptable story, and society embraces him. Until they don't."

I feel eyes on me as she speaks—classmates making the obvious connection between Fitzgerald's critique and our current situation. Ms. Palmer, to her credit, doesn't shy away from the parallel.

"Literature gives us frameworks to understand our own world," she continues. "The questions Fitzgerald raised a century ago are still relevant today. Who gets to control the narrative? Whose version of events becomes the accepted truth? What happens when the performance falls apart?"

My phone vibrates in my pocket—a text from Jordan:

**Jordan:** Principal Davis just announced a student council meeting about "recent events" after school. Avery's hosting.

Of course she is. Another opportunity for Avery to position herself as a leader, to control the conversation, to further her brand as a concerned advocate—all while sidestepping her role in creating the crisis.

I don't respond, slipping my phone away before Ms. Palmer notices. But the knowledge sits heavy in my chest, another example of the system working exactly as designed: rewarding those who game it most effectively, regardless of truth or ethics.

The rest of the morning passes in a blur of classes, each one feeling increasingly disconnected from what matters. How can I focus on calculus when Maya is locked in her room, deleting her art? How can I care about chemistry formulas when Dex is planning some digital revenge that might make everything worse?

By lunch, my nerves are frayed from the constant stares, whispers, and pointed silences that follow me through the hallways. I find Jordan and the Debuggers at their usual table in the corner of the cafeteria—five students with laptops open, heads bent together in serious discussion.

"Casey," Jordan waves me over. "We were just talking about your documentary. How to approach it, what angles to cover."

I slide onto the bench beside him, nodding a greeting to the others. I recognize Lia Chen, a sophomore with a reputation for coding brilliance; Trent Washington, whose YouTube channel about digital ethics has a surprisingly large following; and the Kim twins, Sara and Simon, who run North Point's student tech support.

"First," Trent says, "we need to establish what we're trying to accomplish. Is this about justice for Maya? Exposing Avery? Critiquing the platforms? All of the above?"

"All of it," I say. "But mostly I want to show how the system is designed to reward certain voices and silence others. How algorithms amplify the most sensational, emotionally charged content without regard for truth or consequences."

"That's a big topic," Lia notes, pushing her glasses up her nose. "We need to focus it somehow."

"Through Maya's story," I say immediately. "What happened to her is the perfect case study—the theft of her voice, the public humiliation, the viral meme. It's everything wrong with how digital spaces work, all concentrated in one person's experience."

"Speaking of which," Simon interjects, tapping at his laptop, "we've been tracking the spread. The Maya meme has hit mainstream platforms now—Instagram, Twitter, even Facebook. It's being shared by adults who have no idea who she is or what they're participating in."

Sara picks up her twin's thread. "We've also identified the key accounts that amplified it initially. Three of them follow Avery and were among the first to clip and share the livestream footage."

"Proving what?" Trent asks, ever the pragmatist. "That Avery's followers started it? We already suspected that."

"Proving intent," I say, understanding where the twins are going. "If we can show a coordinated effort to clip and spread the most humiliating moments, that's not just teenagers being cruel. That's a deliberate campaign."

Jordan frowns. "Even if we prove that, what does it change? The platforms won't take action. The school won't discipline Avery. The damage is already done."

"It changes the narrative," I insist. "Right now, this is being treated as an isolated incident—poor Maya had a breakdown, the internet did its thing. But if we can show that it was orchestrated, that it's part of a pattern, maybe people will start asking the right questions."

The table falls silent as they consider this. I can see the hesitation in their faces—the awareness that what I'm proposing won't magically fix what happened to Maya, won't erase the memes or heal her pain.

"Look," I say, breaking the silence, "I know this isn't a perfect solution. Maybe there isn't one. But doing nothing means Avery wins, the system continues unchallenged, and Maya's suffering was for nothing." My voice cracks slightly. "I need to try something."

Jordan places a hand on my arm, his touch light but grounding. "We're with you, Casey. I just want to make sure we're clear-eyed about what we can actually accomplish."

"And about the risks," Lia adds. "Taking on Avery, the platforms, the whole system—there could be blowback."

"I'm already living the blowback," I point out. "What else can they do to me?"

The question hangs in the air, unanswered. We all know there's always more damage to be done, more ways to be targeted, more vulnerabilities to exploit. The digital world offers infinite opportunities for cruelty.

"So," Trent says, pragmatically steering us back to logistics, "what do we need for this documentary? Resources, interviews, footage?"

The discussion turns technical as we outline what's needed—editing software, interview subjects, evidence of the meme's spread, examples of platform failures. The Debuggers divide responsibilities based on their skills, creating a plan of action that feels both manageable and meaningful.

For the first time in days, a sense of purpose cuts through the fog of helplessness. This won't fix everything. It might not fix anything. But it's movement in a direction that feels right—away from revenge, toward truth.

The bell rings, signaling the end of lunch. As we gather our things, Jordan catches my eye.

"Are you still meeting with Dex?" he asks quietly, the others already moving away.

I nod. "I have to try to stop whatever he's planning."

"Be careful," Jordan warns. "People like that—they see the world in binaries. With them or against them. If you reject his approach..."

"I know." I shoulder my backpack, the weight of the afternoon ahead settling heavy on me. "But I have to try."

---

The storage facility that houses The Node looks even more desolate in daylight, its faded paint and rusty doors a stark contrast to the sleek digital world inside Dex's hideout. I tap the familiar pattern on unit 147, bracing myself for what comes next.

The door slides open with a metallic groan. Dex stands in the shadows, his expression unreadable.

"You came," he says, stepping aside to let me in.

"I said I would."

Inside, The Node has transformed since my last visit. New monitors line the walls, cables snake across the floor, and a sophisticated server setup hums in the corner. Dex has been busy, upgrading his capabilities for whatever he's planning.

"Nice remodel," I comment, taking the folding chair he points to.

"I figured if I'm going to war, I should have the right weapons." He sits at his main workstation, swiveling to face me. "So. You wanted to talk. Talk."

No small talk, no warm-up. Just cold efficiency. I take a deep breath, organizing my thoughts.

"I want you to hold off on whatever you're planning against Avery."

"Why?" The question is flat, challenging.

"Because I'm trying a different approach. One that might actually fix the system, not just hurt one person."

Dex laughs, a short, humorless sound. "The documentary. Jordan told me."

The revelation that they've spoken catches me off guard. "You talked to Jordan?"

"He reached out, wanted to 'coordinate efforts.'" Dex makes air quotes, his disdain evident. "I told him the same thing I'm telling you: You can't fix a corrupt system by playing by its rules."

"And you can't change anything by burning it all down," I counter. "That just creates more victims."

"Avery isn't a victim. She's a predator."

"I'm not talking about Avery. I'm talking about collateral damage. About what happens when we use the same tactics we're fighting against."

Dex leans forward, his eyes intense. "Let me show you what I've found. Then tell me if you still think your documentary is enough."

Before I can object, he turns to his computer, fingers flying across the keyboard. Screens fill with data—social media metrics, private messages, email exchanges, financial records.

"I've been inside Avery's digital life for weeks," Dex explains, his voice taking on a lecturer's tone. "Not just her social accounts. Everything. School records, family emails, financial statements. I know more about Avery Liang than she knows about herself."

The violation is so complete it makes me nauseous. This isn't just hacking a social media account—it's a total digital invasion, a stripping away of every privacy barrier.

"That's..." I struggle for words.

"Effective," Dex finishes for me. "And necessary. Look." He pulls up a series of messages between Avery and her father, dated just after the livestream disaster. "She told him what happened, how it 'worked exactly as planned.' Her words, Casey. She bragged about pushing Maya until she broke."

I scan the messages, my stomach turning at Avery's clinical description of Maya's panic attack as "perfect engagement bait." The conversation continues with her father advising her on damage control, suggesting the black-and-white Instagram post about mental health awareness.

"And here," Dex continues, pulling up another window. "Her college application essay draft. She's writing about being a 'digital advocate' who 'gives voice to important issues.' Using this whole situation to position herself as some kind of heroic storyteller."

The depth of Avery's cynicism is staggering. Not just exploiting Maya's pain for immediate gain, but weaving it into her personal narrative, her future plans, her brand identity.

"There's more." Dex's voice hardens as he opens another file. "Financial records from her father's company. The donations to North Point High that keep the administration looking the other way? That's just the beginning. There are suspicious transfers to offshore accounts, payments to 'consultants' that don't seem to exist..."

"Stop," I say, the word sharper than I intended. "This is too much."

Dex turns to me, surprise flickering across his face. "Too much? This is everything you need to destroy her completely. To make sure she never hurts anyone like Maya again."

"By becoming exactly like her? By invading privacy, exploiting vulnerabilities, weaponizing personal information?"

"By fighting fire with fire," he insists. "The system is designed to protect people like Avery. The only way to beat them is to go outside the system."

"Or to change the system," I counter. "To expose how it works, to make people question why it rewards what it does."

Dex shakes his head, frustration evident in every line of his body. "That's a fantasy, Casey. People don't change systems. Systems change people. Look at what happened to you since we started this—you've gotten harder, more pragmatic. The system shaped you, not the other way around."

His observation hits uncomfortably close to home. Haven't I been worried about the same thing? About becoming someone Maya wouldn't recognize, someone I wouldn't recognize?

"Maybe," I concede. "But that doesn't mean I have to keep going down that path. There's still a choice."

"A choice to be ineffective? To let Avery win?"

"A choice to find another way." I stand up, suddenly needing distance from the screens full of stolen data, from the cold calculation in Dex's eyes. "You asked why I wanted you to hold off. It's because whatever you do affects Maya too. If you dump all this online, if you go nuclear on Avery and her family, it just keeps the story alive. It creates more drama, more engagement, more viral content—with Maya still at the center."

Dex falls silent, his eyes narrowed as he considers this.

"Give me two weeks," I press, sensing a crack in his resolve. "Let me finish the documentary, release it my way. If it doesn't work, if nothing changes..." I hesitate, then commit. "Then do what you think is necessary."

"Two weeks," he repeats, skepticism evident in his tone.

"Two weeks," I confirm. "And in the meantime, you keep collecting evidence, but you don't release anything. You don't act unilaterally."

He studies me for a long moment, then swivels back to his computer. "Fine. Two weeks. But Casey—" he glances over his shoulder, his expression hardening again "—when your way fails, don't come crying to me about collateral damage. You had your chance to do this cleanly."

The dismissal is clear. I've gotten what I came for—a temporary reprieve—but at the cost of whatever trust existed between us. Dex sees my choice as weakness, as naivety, as failure.

Part of me wonders if he's right.

As I turn to leave, he calls after me: "By the way, there's a student council meeting today. About 'recent events.'"

"I know," I say, pausing at the door. "Avery's hosting."

"She's planning to announce a 'digital wellness initiative.' A student-led campaign against online harassment." His laugh is bitter. "The perfect way to position herself as the solution rather than the problem."

Even expecting it, the calculated cynicism of Avery's move stuns me. "How do you know this?"

Dex gestures vaguely at his screens. "I know everything she plans before she does it. The question is, what are you going to do about it?"

It's a challenge, a test of my alternative approach. If I truly believe in my documentary path, in systemic change over personal revenge, what's my answer to Avery's latest manipulation?

"I'm going to document it," I say finally. "I'm going to record her performance, her hypocrisy, her strategy. And I'm going to include it in the film—not as an attack on her personally, but as evidence of how the system works."

Dex's expression suggests he finds this approach laughably inadequate. But he doesn't argue further, just turns back to his monitors with a dismissive wave.

As I step outside, the afternoon sun momentarily blinds me, a stark contrast to the artificial darkness of The Node. My phone shows 5:27 PM—the student council meeting started nearly half an hour ago. If I hurry, I might catch the end of Avery's performance.

I consider skipping it entirely. What's the point of witnessing another carefully orchestrated PR exercise? But then I remember what I just told Dex: I'm going to document it. Not just for the film, but for myself—to witness firsthand how Avery operates, how she exploits the system's vulnerabilities.

With new resolve, I head back toward North Point High, my mind already framing how this piece will fit into the larger story I'm trying to tell. A story not just about Maya, or Avery, or me, but about all of us—caught in a digital ecosystem that turns our worst impulses into currency, that rewards cruelty with attention, that transforms human suffering into entertainment.

And somewhere in that story, I hope, lies a path forward. Not just for Maya, but for everyone trapped in the machine.

# Chapter 14

# CHAPTER 14

The student council meeting is already in full swing when I slip into the back of the classroom. The space is packed—not just with council members, but with spectators drawn by Avery's social media promotion of the event. Front and center stands Avery herself, immaculate in a soft gray sweater that screams both "taking this seriously" and "approachable leader."

I pull out my camera, grateful for its small size as I begin recording discreetly from the back row. Documenting, not confronting. Evidence, not revenge.

"—which is why I'm proposing the Digital Wellness Initiative," Avery is saying, her voice pitched to perfect sincerity. "As a community, we've witnessed firsthand how online spaces can become toxic. How rumors, misinformation, and harassment can spiral out of control."

The lack of self-awareness is breathtaking. I zoom in slightly, capturing the practiced compassion in her expression as she continues.

"Our initiative would include peer-led workshops on digital citizenship, anonymous reporting tools for online harassment, and a student support network for those experiencing cyberbullying."

Beside her, Principal Davis nods approvingly. He looks relieved—here's a prefabricated solution that requires minimal administrative effort and maximum PR value. A student-led initiative to address a "community problem" with no specific mention of Maya or what actually happened.

"We can't control the entire internet," Avery continues, "but we can create a culture of respect and accountability at North Point. We can be the change we want to see."

I notice Jordan across the room, his expression carefully neutral as he takes notes. His eyes flick to me, a silent acknowledgment of the performance we're witnessing.

"Questions or comments?" Avery asks, opening the floor with practiced grace.

A junior council member raises her hand. "How would this initiative address viral content that spreads beyond our school community?"

It's a good question—one that cuts to the heart of Maya's situation. The meme has long since escaped the bounds of North Point High, making any school-based solution inherently limited.

"Great question, Mia," Avery says, not missing a beat. "While we can't control what happens beyond our community, we can educate students about the potential consequences of sharing harmful content. The first line of defense is always prevention."

Another masterful deflection. No mention of her role in creating the "harmful content" in the first place. No acknowledgment that she deliberately engineered Maya's breakdown for maximum viral potential.

I keep filming as Avery fields more questions, each answer more polished than the last. She's building her brand in real time—the thoughtful advocate, the community leader, the solution rather than the problem. And everyone is buying it, nodding along, admiring her initiative in the face of a "tragic situation."

I feel a presence beside me and turn to find Ms. Santos sliding into the empty chair.

"Documenting the performance?" she whispers, eyeing my camera.

I nod slightly, keeping the lens trained on Avery.

"Good. Context matters." She keeps her voice low, her eyes forward. "How's Maya?"

"Not good," I whisper back. "She's deleted all her art. Won't talk to anyone. Her parents are looking into professional help."

Ms. Santos winces. "And you? How are you holding up?"

The simple question catches me off guard. Everyone's been so focused on Maya—rightfully so—that I've barely considered my own state.

"I'm..." I hesitate, not sure how to encapsulate the storm of guilt, rage, and determination swirling inside me. "I'm trying to make something good come from this."

She nods, understanding what I'm not saying. "Your documentary?"

"A new version of it. About what happened. About the system that made it possible."

Ms. Santos considers this, her eyes still on Avery at the front of the room. "That could be powerful. And dangerous."

"I know."

"You'll need evidence. Structure. A narrative that goes beyond personal grievance to show the pattern."

"That's what I'm working on," I say, shifting my camera angle slightly to capture Principal Davis's fawning reaction to Avery's latest comment.

"If you need resources," Ms. Santos offers, "the News Lab is always open to you."

The offer of support—practical, specific—warms something cold inside me. "Thank you."

At the front of the room, Avery is wrapping up, her voice rising with inspirational fervor. "So I'm asking for volunteers to join the Digital Wellness Committee. Together, we can create a safer online environment for everyone at North Point."

Hands shoot up around the room. Of course they do. Association with Avery's initiative means social capital, resume fodder, and the warm glow of appearing to care about "issues." It's win-win for everyone except Maya, who remains unmentioned, erased from the very narrative that's supposedly addressing her situation.

I stop recording as the meeting dissolves into informal conversation, Avery at the center of an admiring circle of students and teachers. The performance is complete. The transformation from perpetrator to savior seamlessly executed.

"She's good," Ms. Santos murmurs beside me, a grudging professional respect in her tone. "If I didn't know better, I'd believe every word."

"That's what makes her dangerous," I reply, packing away my camera. "She believes it too."

As we slip out of the crowded classroom, I spot Jordan extricating himself from a conversation to join us.

"Well, that was quite a show," he says once we're in the hallway.

"Complete with volunteer sign-up sheets and a hashtag," I note. "#DigitalWellnessNow. Already printed on buttons."

"She works fast," Ms. Santos observes. "The livestream was only three days ago."

The timeline jolts me. Has it really been just three days since Maya's breakdown? It feels like weeks, months—a gulf of time and pain separating then from now.

"Casey got footage of the whole thing," Jordan tells Ms. Santos. "For the documentary."

Ms. Santos nods approvingly. "Good. This is exactly the kind of systemic response that needs documenting. The way institutions repackage problems into opportunities, the way they..."

She trails off, her attention caught by something over my shoulder. I turn to see Principal Davis approaching, his expression fixed in that particular administrative blend of concern and authority.

"Ms. Morales," he says, stopping before our small group. "I've been hoping to speak with you."

Ms. Santos straightens subtly beside me, a silent signal of support.

"About?" I ask, keeping my voice neutral.

"Your recent absences, for one. And the... situation with your friend Maya." His voice lowers on her name, as if speaking it too loudly might conjure uncomfortable realities. "We're concerned about your wellbeing."

The sudden institutional interest in my "wellbeing" after days of silence rings hollow. Where was this concern when Maya was being targeted? When Avery stole my work? When the harassment started?

"I'm fine," I say flatly. "Maya is the one you should be concerned about."

Principal Davis shifts uncomfortably. "Yes, well, the Restrepos have been in touch. We're offering resources, of course. But Ms. Liang's initiative may actually be helpful in preventing future incidents—"

"Future incidents," I repeat, the euphemism igniting something sharp inside me. "You mean future orchestrated public humiliations? Future campaigns of targeted harassment?"

Ms. Santos places a gentle hand on my arm—a warning to moderate my tone. I take a deep breath, forcing my voice level.

"Maya wasn't caught in some abstract 'incident,' Principal Davis. She was deliberately set up and humiliated on camera. And now Avery, who engineered the whole thing, gets to lead a 'wellness initiative' with the school's blessing."

Principal Davis's expression hardens slightly. "Those are serious accusations, Ms. Morales. Without evidence—"

"I have evidence," I interrupt. "Server logs showing the theft of my documentary footage. Private messages planning the livestream as a trap. Coordinated harassment from accounts linked to Avery's inner circle."

It's not entirely a lie. Between what Jordan's group has gathered and what Dex has shown me, the evidence exists. I just don't have direct access to all of it.

Principal Davis blinks, clearly not expecting this response. "Well, if you have concerns about student conduct, there are proper channels—"

"The same channels that ignored Maya's harassment? That allowed a student to steal another's work with no consequences?" My voice rises despite my efforts to control it. "Those channels?"

"Casey," Ms. Santos murmurs, her grip on my arm tightening slightly.

Principal Davis draws himself up, administrative authority replacing his veneer of concern. "I understand you're upset, Ms. Morales. But I would caution you against making unfounded accusations or disrupting positive initiatives like Ms. Liang's. North Point has a reputation for constructive problem-solving, not divisive finger-pointing."

There it is—the school's true priority laid bare. Reputation. Positive image. "Constructive problem-solving" that never names the actual problem or holds anyone accountable.

"I understand perfectly," I say, the calm in my voice belying the anger beneath. "Excuse me."

I turn and walk away before I say something I can't take back, something that would give him reason to escalate this from "concern" to disciplinary action. Jordan follows quickly, with Ms. Santos lingering to smooth things over with the principal.

"That was intense," Jordan says once we're around the corner.

"That was illuminating," I correct, my hands still shaking slightly with repressed anger. "Another piece of evidence for the documentary. The institutional protection of reputation over justice."

Jordan glances back toward where we left the principal. "You really do have all that evidence you mentioned?"

"Some of it. The Debuggers have the harassment data. And..." I hesitate, not sure how much to reveal about Dex's more invasive methods.

"And your other source has the rest," Jordan finishes for me, his expression careful. "The one who offered more extreme solutions."

I nod, not elaborating. "I convinced him to hold off. For two weeks. To give the documentary approach a chance."

"That's good," Jordan says, relief evident in his voice. "Escalation hasn't exactly helped so far."

"No, it hasn't." I think of Maya, locked in her room, deleting her art. Of the meme spreading beyond our control. Of each attempt to fight back somehow making things worse.

My phone buzzes with a text from my mom:

**Mom:** On my way home. Picked up dinner. We still need to talk about school.

Reality crashes back—the ordinary world of attendance policies, family dinners, and parental concerns continuing alongside the digital catastrophe consuming my life.

"I have to go," I tell Jordan. "My mom wants to talk about my absences."

"Are you in trouble?"

"Probably. The school called her." I sigh, the prospect of another confrontation draining what little energy I have left. "We'll talk tomorrow? About the documentary plan?"

"Definitely. The Debuggers are meeting at lunch to organize all the evidence we've gathered. You should join us."

"I will." I hesitate, then add, "Thanks, Jordan. For everything."

He smiles, a small, genuine expression that cuts through some of the day's darkness. "That's what friends do."

---

Mom is setting the table when I get home, cartons of Chinese takeout arranged in the center. Her work uniform is gone, replaced by comfortable home clothes, but the tired lines around her eyes remain.

"Perfect timing," she says, glancing up as I enter. "Food's still hot."

I drop my backpack by the door, the familiar domestic scene creating a strange dissonance with the chaos of everything else. "Smells good."

We fill our plates in silence, the unspoken conversation looming between us. Finally, Mom sets down her fork and meets my eyes.

"The school called. Three unexcused absences this week."

I push rice around my plate. "I know."

"Casey, I understand that things are difficult right now. With Maya, with everything that's happened. But you can't just stop going to school."

"I went today," I offer weakly.

"For part of the day," she corrects. "According to your attendance record, you missed morning classes."

I don't have a good response to this. It's true. I've been selectively attending, prioritizing my documentary work and meetings with Dex over classes that suddenly seem trivial in comparison.

"I'm sorry," I say, because it's easier than explaining.

Mom studies my face, concern replacing the initial frustration in her expression. "Talk to me, Casey. What's really going on? And don't say 'nothing.' I know you better than that."

The simple invitation to honesty breaks something loose inside me. Before I can stop them, tears well up, spilling over onto my cheeks.

"Oh, honey." Mom is immediately around the table, pulling me into her arms like she did when I was small. "It's okay. It's going to be okay."

But it's not okay. Nothing about this situation is okay. And the comfort of my mother's embrace only highlights how alone Maya must feel, how isolated in her pain.

"It's my fault," I choke out, the guilt that's been building for days finally finding voice. "I got Maya into this. I failed to protect her. And now she's—she's—"

"Shh," Mom soothes, stroking my hair. "This isn't your fault. You didn't create this situation."

"But I made it worse," I insist, pulling back to look at her. "Every time I tried to fight back, to fix it, I just made things worse. And now Maya won't even talk to me, and the meme is everywhere, and Avery is turning the whole thing into a PR opportunity, and I don't know how to make it stop."

The words pour out in a rush, all the fear and frustration and helplessness of the past week crashing together into one incoherent wave. Mom listens without interrupting, her hands steady on my shoulders.

When I finally run out of words, she wipes a tear from my cheek with her thumb, her expression gentle but serious.

"Casey, listen to me. You are not responsible for Avery's actions. You are not responsible for how platforms amplify cruelty. You are not responsible for a system that rewards the wrong things."

Her understanding of the situation surprises me. I've been so wrapped up in my own guilt that I haven't considered she might see the bigger picture too.

"But I am responsible for involving Maya," I counter. "For starting this documentary in the first place."

"Your documentary didn't cause this," Mom says firmly. "Avery's theft and exploitation did. The platforms that prioritize engagement over ethics did. The school's failure to protect its students did." She squeezes my shoulders gently. "You're trying to expose a broken system, Casey. That's not wrong. It's brave."

Her validation—unexpected, unequivocal—loosens something tight in my chest. I've been carrying so much guilt that I've lost sight of the original injustice, the theft that started all of this.

"I'm trying to finish it," I admit. "The documentary. Not just about digital inequality anymore, but about what happened to Maya. About how the system worked exactly as designed, rewarding the loudest, cruelest voices."

Mom nods slowly. "That could be powerful. Painful, but necessary."

"You're not going to tell me to let it go? To stop causing trouble?"

A shadow crosses her face—regret for her earlier caution, perhaps. "No. I'm not going to tell you that. I was wrong before, to prioritize security over justice." She takes a deep breath. "Your father would have been ashamed of me for that."

The mention of my dad—rare, always meaningful—lands like a physical touch. He died when I was eleven, but his principles, his belief in standing up for what's right, have remained a guiding force in our home.

"He would have been proud of you," Mom continues, her voice steady despite the emotion in her eyes. "For using your voice, your talent, to expose truth. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard."

The validation brings fresh tears, but different ones—cleansing rather than despairing. "I miss him."

"I know. Me too." Mom pulls me close again, and for a moment, we share the grief that never fully leaves, that lives alongside everything else in our lives. Then she straightens, practical as always. "Now, about school. I understand why you've been absent, but we need to address this before it becomes a bigger issue."

"I know. I'll go tomorrow. All day," I promise.

"And the documentary? How can I help?"

The offer takes me by surprise. "You want to help?"

"Of course I do. This matters to you. It matters, period." She smiles slightly. "Besides, I have two days off this weekend. Put me to work."

For the first time in days, something like hope flickers in my chest. Not the desperate determination that's been driving me, but something warmer, more sustainable. The knowledge that I'm not alone in this fight.

"Actually," I say, "there is something you could help with. I need an adult perspective on how these platforms monetize engagement. On how the business model rewards certain types of content."

Mom's eyes light up with understanding. "The service economy of the digital world. The labor that creates value for tech companies." She nods decisively. "I can speak to that. From the trenches of Solas's cafeteria, no less."

Her willingness to contribute, to risk her position at Solas by speaking out, means more than I can express. "Are you sure? Mr. Liang..."

"Is on the board, yes. But I'm not naming names or violating any confidentiality. I'm just speaking to my experience as a worker in an industry that profits from the dynamics you're documenting." She squares her shoulders, a familiar gesture of determination. "Some things are worth standing up for, Casey. Your father taught me that."

We finish dinner with a new sense of purpose, the earlier heaviness lifted somewhat by shared resolve. As we clean up, Mom asks casual questions about the documentary's structure, offering suggestions from her perspective as someone less immersed in digital culture.

Later, in my room, I review the footage from the student council meeting, watching Avery's performance with new analytical distance. There's a clarity that comes with purpose, with knowing this isn't just about personal grievance but about exposing a system that hurts people by design.

My phone buzzes with a text from Jordan:

**Jordan:** Good news. Debuggers identified the main accounts that spread Maya's meme initially. Three directly connected to Avery's inner circle. Proof of coordinated effort.

I type back:

**Me:** Perfect. Can you compile that for tomorrow's meeting?

**Jordan:** Already on it. Also, heads up—Avery's Digital Wellness Initiative is all over InstaFrame. Getting massive positive engagement.

I'm not surprised. Of course the platform would amplify Avery's performance of concern. It's the perfect narrative—visually appealing, emotionally engaging, devoid of uncomfortable complexity. The system working exactly as designed.

**Me:** Document everything. It's all evidence.

I set my phone aside and turn back to my laptop, where the framework of my documentary is taking shape. What started as an academic exploration of digital inequality has evolved into something more urgent, more personal, more necessary.

A signal through the noise.

Outside my window, night has fallen completely, the streetlights casting pools of yellow on the quiet street. Somewhere across town, Maya is alone in her darkened room, still suffering the consequences of a system that turned her pain into entertainment. And somewhere else, Avery is basking in the glow of positive engagement, her reputation not just intact but enhanced by her skillful manipulation of the narrative.

The injustice of it burns, a constant, smoldering anger beneath everything else. But now that anger has direction, purpose, a channel toward something constructive rather than purely destructive.

I open a new document and begin typing, the words flowing with unexpected clarity:

*THE SIGNAL: A Documentary*
*By Casey Morales*

*This is the story of what happens when the system decides whose voices matter.*

*This is the story of Maya Restrepo, whose vulnerability was weaponized for engagement.*

*This is the story of platforms designed to amplify the loudest, regardless of truth.*

*This is the story of what we lose when human experience becomes content to be consumed.*

The cursor blinks after the last sentence, waiting. There's so much more to say, to show, to expose. But it's a start. A declaration of purpose. A promise to use my voice for something that matters.

In the quiet of my room, with the weight of Maya's silence heavy in my heart but my mother's support fortifying my resolve, I begin the real work of telling this story. Not for revenge. Not for justice. But for truth.

Because in a world of manufactured noise, truth is the only signal worth sending.

# Chapter 15

# CHAPTER 15

At 4:13 AM, my phone rings. 

The sound cuts through the darkness, jarring me from a fitful sleep filled with digital ghosts and Maya's tear-streaked face. I fumble for the device, squinting at the screen. Mrs. Restrepo.

My heart stops.

"Hello?" My voice comes out as a croak.

The silence on the other end stretches for three excruciating seconds before Mrs. Restrepo speaks. "Casey." Her voice is hollow, scraped raw. "Maya's gone."

The world tilts sideways. "Gone?" I repeat stupidly, unable to process what she's saying. "What do you mean, gone?"

"She—" Mrs. Restrepo's voice breaks. "We found her room empty this morning. She left a note. Just said she 'couldn't do this anymore.' We've called the police, but they say they can't do anything for twenty-four hours unless there's clear evidence of—" She can't finish the sentence.

Relief and fresh terror war within me. Not dead. But missing. The distinction feels fragile, temporary.

"I'll help look," I say, already fumbling for clothes in the dark. "Where have you checked? Does she have any places she might go?"

"We've called everyone, checked the park, the beach—all her usual spots." Mrs. Restrepo sounds like she's aged a decade overnight. "Casey, she deleted everything on her phone before she left. All her contacts, her photos, everything. Like she was... erasing herself."

The phrase slices through me. Erasing herself. Just like she erased her art. A systematic removal of her digital footprint before...

I can't complete the thought.

"I'm coming over," I say. "I'll be there in fifteen minutes."

I hang up and finish dressing, movements mechanical. Should I wake Mom? Leave a note? My brain feels wrapped in cotton, unable to process simple decisions through the haze of panic.

In the end, I scribble a quick note—*Emergency with Maya. Call when you wake up*—and place it on the kitchen counter. Then I'm out the door, breaking into a run through the pre-dawn darkness.

The streets are empty at this hour, the world still sleeping while disaster unfolds. I push myself harder, lungs burning, as if speed alone could somehow reverse time, could put Maya safely back in her room before whatever comes next.

The Restrepo house is lit up like a beacon, every window blazing against the night. Mr. Restrepo opens the door before I can knock, his face gaunt with worry.

"Any news?" I ask, breathless from running.

He shakes his head. "Police are taking a report, but..." The frustration in his voice is palpable. Without evidence of immediate danger, Maya is just one more teenager who's run away, not a priority in a system overwhelmed with cases.

Inside, the house hums with tense energy. Mrs. Restrepo is on the phone, pacing the living room. Maya's younger brother, Santiago, sits on the stairs in pajamas, his small face pinched with confusion and fear. Two police officers stand in the entryway, looking simultaneously sympathetic and bureaucratic as they take notes.

"...seventeen years old, about five-foot-four, dark hair, brown eyes," Mrs. Restrepo is saying into the phone, her voice strained with the effort of remaining calm. "Last seen wearing—" She looks to Mr. Restrepo, who shakes his head helplessly. They don't know what she was wearing. No one saw her leave.

"Casey." Mr. Restrepo pulls me aside, lowering his voice. "Did Maya say anything to you recently? Anything that might indicate where she would go?"

I shake my head, guilt a physical weight in my chest. "She wouldn't talk to me. She blamed me for what happened." The admission burns my throat. "But I can help look. I can post on social media, ask people to—"

"No!" The force of his response startles me. "No more social media. That's what drove her to this."

He's right, of course. The thought of using the very platforms that destroyed Maya's peace to find her now feels obscene. But what alternatives do we have?

"I'll start with physical places," I say, trying to think practically through the panic. "The old lighthouse. The library. The back corner of Memorial Park where she used to draw."

Mr. Restrepo nods gratefully. "I've already checked the park, but not the lighthouse. And the library doesn't open until nine."

"I'll try everywhere," I promise. "And I'll call the moment I find anything."

As I turn to leave, Mrs. Restrepo catches my arm, the phone still pressed to her ear. "Casey," she says, covering the mouthpiece. "Be careful. If you find her..." She doesn't finish, but I understand. If I find Maya, she might not want to be found. She might be in a dangerous state of mind. I need to approach with caution.

"I will," I assure her.

Outside, the sky is beginning to lighten, a pale gray seeping into the black. I stand on the sidewalk for a moment, overwhelmed by the enormity of the task. Maya could be anywhere. She could have taken a bus out of town. She could be hiding somewhere no one would think to look. She could be—

I cut off the thought. Focus. Think like Maya. Where would she go if she wanted to disappear? If she wanted to escape the digital harassment that has consumed her life?

I start walking, pulling out my phone to text Jordan. Time to call in reinforcements, digital or not.

---

By noon, we've found nothing.

Jordan and the Debuggers have systematically searched every place Maya might conceivably go—the old lighthouse, the beach caves, the abandoned community garden she once sketched, even the roof of the apartment building where her grandmother used to live. I've checked the bus station, confirming no one matching Maya's description bought a ticket in the last twenty-four hours. Mom has joined the search, driving the coastal road and checking scenic overlooks where a distressed teenager might seek solitude.

Nothing.

The Restrepos' house has become a command center, with friends and family arriving to help coordinate the search. The police have finally upgraded their response, considering Maya's recent mental state and the circumstances of her disappearance. Her face now appears on a missing persons alert, the irony crushing—Maya, who wanted so desperately to disappear from public view, now has her image distributed across the community.

I stand in her bedroom, hoping for insight, for some clue we've missed. The space is still eerily barren, stripped of personality. The note she left is on her desk, just three handwritten lines:

*I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry. Please don't look for me. I need to go somewhere they can't find me.*

They. Not we, or you. They. The faceless digital mob that turned her pain into entertainment. The platforms that amplified her humiliation. The classmates who shared and laughed and commented without thought for the human being on the other side.

My phone buzzes—a text from Jordan:

**Jordan:** Still nothing at the marina or the old mill. Heading to check the hiking trails now.

I type back a quick acknowledgment, then return to scanning the room. There must be something, some hint of where she's gone. Maya is meticulous, organized even in crisis. If she planned to disappear, she would have...

I freeze, a memory surfacing.

*"Sometimes I think about just going off the grid completely," Maya said once, months ago, as we walked along the bay. "Finding some cabin in the woods with no Wi-Fi, no cell service. Just me and my sketchbooks."*

*"You'd last two days before you needed to Google something," I joked.*

*"There's a place, though," she continued, ignoring my teasing. "My dad's cousin has this hunting cabin up near Crystal Lake. No electricity, no running water. Complete digital detox. We went once when I was twelve. It was so quiet I could hear myself think."*

Crystal Lake. A three-hour drive north. Remote, isolated, perfect for someone seeking to escape the digital world entirely.

I rush downstairs, finding Mr. Restrepo in the kitchen, making coffee for the search volunteers.

"The cabin," I say breathlessly. "Your cousin's hunting cabin at Crystal Lake. Could she have gone there?"

His eyes widen with recognition, then narrow in thought. "It's possible. But how would she get there? She doesn't drive."

"Bus to Mountainview, then maybe a taxi? Or hitchhiking?" The possibilities tumble out. "Can we call your cousin? Check if anyone's been there?"

"He's in Costa Rica until next month." Mr. Restrepo is already reaching for his car keys. "But there's a neighbor who keeps an eye on the place. I'll call him on the way."

Hope, fragile but real, blooms in my chest. "I'm coming with you."

"No." His refusal is firm. "You stay here, coordinate with the others. If we're wrong about this, we need people continuing the search here." He places a hand on my shoulder. "I'll call the moment I know anything."

I want to argue but can see the logic in his plan. If Maya isn't at the cabin, we can't afford to have everyone focused on one false lead.

"Okay," I agree reluctantly. "But please, call as soon as—"

"I will." He's already heading for the door, shouting for Mrs. Restrepo.

Left alone in the kitchen, I sink into a chair, the adrenaline of potential discovery giving way to the weight of uncertainty. What if we're wrong? What if the cabin is empty? What if Maya is somewhere else entirely, somewhere darker, more final?

My phone buzzes again—Dex this time:

**Dex:** Heard about Maya. Need to talk. Urgent.

I stare at the message, a chill running through me. How did Dex know about Maya? We've deliberately kept the search off social media. Unless...

**Me:** How did you find out?

**Dex:** I have alerts set up for her name across platforms. Police report hit the system an hour ago. Meet me at The Node ASAP.

My first instinct is to ignore him. Finding Maya is the priority, not whatever revenge scheme Dex is cooking up. But something in his message—the urgency, the fact that he has alerts set for Maya's name—makes me pause. What if he has information that could help?

**Me:** Can't leave the search. Whatever it is, tell me now.

His response is immediate:

**Dex:** Not over text. This is bigger than you know. The Node. One hour. Or I move forward alone.

The implied threat in his last statement settles like ice in my stomach. Dex moving forward "alone" could mean anything—a digital attack that could complicate the search for Maya, a scorched-earth campaign against Avery that would create new headlines, new complications.

I glance at the clock. Mr. and Mrs. Restrepo have been gone less than five minutes, heading toward a cabin three hours away. The police are coordinating with other departments. Jordan and the Debuggers are systematically covering ground. My mom is searching the coastal areas.

There's nothing more I can actively do here in the next hour that others aren't already doing.

**Me:** Fine. One hour. But only because it might help find Maya.

I find Mrs. Restrepo's sister in the living room, explain that I'm meeting someone who might have information, and promise to return immediately afterward. She nods distractedly, too overwhelmed by the situation to question me further.

Outside, the day has turned overcast, the air heavy with impending rain. It feels appropriate somehow—the physical world reflecting the emotional storm brewing. I walk quickly toward the storage facility, each step heavy with the dual weight of Maya's disappearance and whatever Dex is about to reveal.

---

The Node feels different when I arrive—colder, more sterile than its usual chaotic energy. Dex sits at his main workstation, his posture rigid, face illuminated by the blue glow of multiple monitors.

"You came," he says without turning.

"You said it was urgent." I remain standing near the door, reluctant to fully enter his space. "If you have information about Maya—"

"I might." He swivels to face me, his expression grave. "But first, you need to see what happened after the livestream. The full picture of what drove her to this."

My patience, already thin, snaps. "I know what happened. I've seen the memes, the comments, the radio shows. I've watched my best friend disappear into herself day by day. I don't need a recap."

"You've seen the surface," Dex counters, unperturbed by my anger. "I've been tracking deeper. The private groups. The Discord servers. The organized campaigns targeting her specifically." He gestures to one of the monitors. "What you've seen is bad. What you haven't seen is worse."

Despite my reluctance, I step closer, looking at the screen he indicates. It shows a private Discord server titled "Maya Meltdown Central," with thousands of members. The content makes my blood run cold—detailed plans for harassing Maya across platforms, her personal information posted for all to see, celebratory messages when she deleted her art accounts.

"This isn't random internet cruelty," Dex explains, scrolling through more messages. "This is organized, targeted harassment. And guess who's at the center of it?"

He pulls up another screen showing a user with the handle "QueenA_Admin" moderating the Discord server, giving directions on "keeping the pressure on" and "making sure she can't escape."

"Avery," I breathe, though I'm not really surprised. The calculated cruelty feels entirely in character.

"Not just Avery. Her whole inner circle." Dex clicks through more screenshots—Emma, Jason, and others from Avery's clique participating in the campaign, creating fake accounts to harass Maya, coordinating their attacks to ensure maximum impact.

"They've been doing this for days," Dex continues. "Ever since the livestream. They turned harassment into a game, with points for making Maya react, for finding new ways to make sure she sees the memes, for pushing her further into isolation."

Each new piece of evidence feels like a physical blow. This wasn't just passive participation in a cruel trend. This was deliberate, sustained psychological warfare waged against a seventeen-year-old girl already on the edge.

"Why?" I ask, my voice barely audible. "Why target her so specifically?"

"Because she stood up to Avery. Because she called her out publicly during the livestream. And because—" Dex pulls up another screen, showing messages between Avery and Emma "—Maya was 'the perfect test case' for seeing how far they could push someone."

I read the message, nausea rising in my throat:

*QueenA: Maya was always a headcase. Perfect test case for what happens when you push the right buttons. Plus now we have content for DAYS*

*Em_Campbell: Isn't this getting a little intense? Like what if she actually hurts herself?*

*QueenA: Drama queen. She'll be fine. Besides, this is GOLD for my college apps—"created viral conversation around mental health awareness" 😉*

The casual cruelty, the complete disregard for Maya as a human being, the cold calculation of turning her suffering into a resume builder—it's beyond anything I imagined, even knowing what Avery is capable of.

"When was this sent?" I ask, my voice shaking.

"Yesterday afternoon," Dex replies. "After Maya deleted all her art. After she was already in crisis."

"And Avery knew? She knew how bad it was getting?"

"She orchestrated how bad it was getting." Dex's voice hardens. "This wasn't accidental. This wasn't a meme that got out of hand. This was a deliberate campaign to break someone for content, for engagement, for a college application bullet point."

I sink into the chair beside him, legs suddenly unable to support me. If what Dex is showing me is true—and the evidence seems undeniable—then Avery isn't just complicit in Maya's suffering. She's the architect of it. The puppet master pulling strings from behind a carefully constructed façade of concern.

"There's more," Dex says, his voice dropping. "Earlier today, after Maya was reported missing, this appeared in their private chat."

He pulls up another message thread, this one from just hours ago:

*QueenA: Heard panic girl is missing. Think she finally snapped?*

*Jason_L: Probably just for attention. She'll turn up.*

*QueenA: Either way, perfect timing for my Digital Wellness Initiative. "Community comes together in wake of tragedy" has a nice ring to it.*

I stare at the messages, something cold and hard crystallizing in my chest. Even now, with Maya missing and potentially in danger, Avery is thinking about how to leverage the situation for her brand. How to turn someone else's tragedy into her triumph.

"Now do you understand?" Dex asks quietly. "This isn't just about stolen footage anymore. This is about someone who systematically destroyed another human being for social capital, and is now planning to profit from the aftermath."

I do understand. With perfect, terrible clarity. The documentary suddenly seems inadequate, too slow, too measured a response to the deliberate cruelty Dex has just shown me. What good is exposing the truth weeks from now, when Maya is missing today? What good is systemic critique when a specific person has caused such specific harm?

"What are you proposing?" I ask, the words tasting like ash in my mouth.

Dex's expression shifts, a cold satisfaction that he's finally gotten through to me. "I've been developing options. Ways to make Avery face real consequences, not just reputational damage or lost brand deals."

He turns back to his monitors, pulling up a complex flowchart that maps out what looks like a comprehensive attack plan.

"Option one: Full digital exposure. Everything I showed you last time—her private messages, her father's financial irregularities, her college essay drafts—released simultaneously across all platforms. Not anonymously, but framed as whistleblowing by a named source with evidence."

The screen shifts to show a draft webpage titled "The Avery Liang Files," complete with downloadable evidence packages and testimony from multiple sources.

"Option two: Targeted institutional consequences. We provide carefully selected evidence to her dream colleges, showing her role in orchestrating harassment that led to a student's disappearance. No public spectacle, but a quiet ending to her Ivy League aspirations."

Another shift, showing draft emails to admissions offices at Princeton, Yale, and Stanford—Avery's top choices, according to her private documents.

"Option three: The nuclear option." Dex's voice takes on an edge I haven't heard before. "We don't just expose Avery. We expose the entire Liang family. The offshore accounts. The labor violations at their overseas factories. The internal emails about 'acceptable casualty rates' in their production facilities."

The screen now shows an intricate web of documents, emails, and financial records that implicate not just Avery but her entire family in what appears to be serious corporate misconduct.

"That would destroy them," I say, the scale of what he's proposing finally sinking in. "Not just Avery's college prospects or social standing. Their whole lives."

"Yes." Dex doesn't flinch from the implication. "Just like they destroyed Maya's."

The comparison lands with terrible weight. Maya, who deleted her art, erased her digital presence, and has now physically disappeared—her entire sense of self systematically dismantled by a campaign Avery personally directed. An eye for an eye. A life for a life.

"How soon could you implement these?" I ask, a part of me horrified that I'm even considering it.

"The first option, immediately. I have everything prepared. The second, within 24 hours—I'd need to create secure channels to the institutions. The third..." He hesitates. "That's more complex. We'd need to ensure the evidence is irrefutable, that the impact can't be contained by Liang family lawyers. A week, maybe less."

A week. Maya has been missing for less than a day. If the worst has happened—if she's harmed herself—a week might be too late for justice. For consequences that matter.

"And the risks?" I force myself to ask. "To us, I mean."

"Minimal for options one and two. I've built in layers of protection, anonymous routing, plausible deniability. Option three carries more risk. The Liangs have resources, connections. They could push for a serious investigation."

I stand up and pace the small space, my thoughts racing. The documentary feels increasingly like bringing a textbook to a gunfight—theoretically sound but practically useless in the immediate crisis. Maya is missing now. Avery is orchestrating harassment now. The damage is happening now.

"What would Maya want?" I ask, more to myself than to Dex.

"Does it matter?" he counters, his voice hard. "Maya's not here to want anything. That's the point."

The brutal truth of his statement hits me like a physical blow. Maya isn't here. She's missing, possibly in danger, definitely in pain. And Avery is still here, still thriving, still planning to leverage the situation for her brand.

Is this what justice looks like? Destroying Avery as completely as she destroyed Maya? Creating a perfect symmetry of ruin?

Or is it just revenge, dressed up in the language of consequences?

Dex watches me struggle, his expression unreadable. "Time's running out, Casey. If Maya really has hurt herself, if this becomes a different kind of news story tomorrow, our window for action narrows. The narrative will shift. Avery will position herself as the grieving friend, the mental health advocate who 'tried to help.' We need to move before that happens."

The calculated way he discusses even this most terrible possibility—Maya's death—should repulse me. Instead, I find myself nodding, seeing the cold logic of his timeline. If the worst has happened, Avery will indeed seize the narrative, turning tragedy into opportunity with the same skill she's displayed throughout this crisis.

"I need to think," I say, moving toward the door.

"There's no time for thinking," Dex argues, frustration edging into his voice. "Every minute we wait is another minute Avery gets away with what she did. Another minute she profits from Maya's pain."

"Just give me an hour," I insist. "I need to check if there's any news about Maya. I need to—"

"You need to decide," Dex interrupts, standing now, his tall frame tense with urgency. "Are you in, or are you out? Do we make Avery pay for what she's done, or do we let her continue weaponizing the system against people like Maya? Against people like your mother, struggling to keep her job while the Liangs play with lives like they're disposable?"

The mention of my mother—of the broader pattern of privilege and power the Liangs represent—lands precisely as Dex intended. This isn't just about Maya and Avery anymore. It's about a system that protects those who already have power while crushing those who don't. A system my documentary meant to critique but can't actually change, not fast enough to matter.

My phone buzzes in my pocket—a text from Jordan:

**Jordan:** Any word from the Restrepos? Nothing new here. Running out of places to look.

The message brings me back to the immediate reality: Maya is still missing. The search continues. And Avery, somewhere across town, is crafting her next social media post, perhaps already framing Maya's disappearance as an opportunity for her Digital Wellness Initiative.

I look at Dex, at the evidence spread across his monitors, at the plans he's meticulously crafted to bring real consequences to someone who has caused real harm. The choice crystallizes before me—continue playing by rules that protect Avery, or step outside those rules to create justice the system won't provide.

"Okay," I say, the word feeling both terrible and inevitable as it leaves my mouth. "Show me exactly how option one works. The full digital exposure."

Dex's face betrays a brief flash of triumph before settling back into focused determination. "Sit down," he says, turning to his keyboard. "I'll walk you through it step by step."

As I take the seat beside him, watching him pull up files and scripts and timelines, I feel something shift inside me—a line crossed, a transformation from who I was to who I'm becoming. The Casey who believed in systems, in institutions, in playing by the rules is fading. In her place emerges someone harder, someone willing to break rules to fix what's broken.

For Maya. For justice. For whatever comes next.

Outside The Node, rain begins to fall, pattering against the metal roof of the storage unit. I wonder if it's raining at Crystal Lake too, if Maya is huddled in that remote cabin, seeking escape from a digital world that turned her pain into entertainment. I wonder if she'll ever come back, if she'll ever forgive me for failing to protect her.

I wonder if I'll recognize myself when this is over.

But as Dex outlines his plan for Avery's destruction—clinical, comprehensive, irrefutable—I find I don't care about recognition anymore. I only care about consequences. About balance. About making someone pay for what they've done.

"Are you ready?" Dex asks, finger hovering over the key that will set everything in motion.

I nod, something cold and resolved settling in my chest where grief and uncertainty churned just hours before.

"Do it."

# Chapter 16

# CHAPTER 16

"Do it."

The words hang in the air between us, heavy with finality. Dex's finger hovers over the Enter key, his expression a mask of cold satisfaction. One keystroke and Avery's entire digital life—her private messages, her orchestrated harassment campaign, her family's secrets—will be exposed to the world. One keystroke and there's no going back.

"Are you sure?" Dex asks, though his tone suggests he already knows the answer. "Once I hit this, it's done. The files go to journalists, social media, her colleges. Everyone."

"I'm sure," I say, even as something deep in my chest constricts. "She destroyed Maya. She deserves this."

Dex nods and turns back to his screen. The room feels suddenly airless, the hum of computer fans the only sound besides the rain hammering against the metal roof. I watch his finger descend toward the key in slow motion, my heartbeat thundering in my ears.

And then my phone rings.

We both freeze. The screen illuminates with Jordan's name, the ringtone jarring against the tense silence. I fumble for it, nearly dropping the device in my haste.

"Jordan?" I answer, my voice strained. "Did they find her?"

"No," he says, and my heart plummets. "But Casey, I need to tell you something before you do anything drastic."

The specific wording sends a chill through me. "What do you mean?"

"I know you're with Dex," Jordan says, his voice careful. "The Debuggers traced his access to the school directory when he got your number. We know he's been showing you evidence about Avery. And we know he's planning something big."

I glance at Dex, who's watching me with narrowed eyes, finger still poised above the key.

"Casey," Jordan continues when I don't respond, "whatever he's convinced you to do—don't. It won't help Maya. It won't fix anything."

"You don't understand what Avery did," I say, anger flaring. "Dex showed me everything. The Discord servers, the coordinated harassment campaign. She was celebrating Maya's breakdown, Jordan. She was using it for her college applications."

"I believe you," he says, his voice steady. "But scorched earth tactics won't undo what happened."

"It's not about undoing it. It's about consequences. It's about justice."

"Is it?" Jordan challenges. "Or is it about making yourself feel better? About having someone to blame when the real enemy is a system that rewards cruelty?"

His words land like a physical blow, uncomfortably close to the doubt gnawing at the edges of my certainty. Dex gestures impatiently, pointing at his screen, silently asking if he should proceed.

"I have to go," I tell Jordan.

"Wait!" His voice is urgent now. "Remember why you started your documentary in the first place. Remember what Maya believed in. Would she want this?"

The question catches me off guard. Would Maya want this? I've been so focused on justice, on consequences, on my own desperate need to make someone pay that I haven't stopped to consider what Maya herself would want.

"I'll call you back," I say, and hang up before he can respond.

Dex is still waiting, his impatience now palpable. "We're losing our window, Casey. Either we do this now or we don't do it at all."

"Just—" I hold up a hand, my thoughts suddenly chaotic. "Just give me a minute."

"We don't have a minute." Dex's voice hardens. "Every second we wait is another second Avery gets away with what she did."

But I'm not listening anymore. Instead, I'm remembering Maya—not the shell of herself she became after the livestream, but the Maya I knew before all this began. Maya who stopped posting her art not because she was afraid, but because she refused to "feed a system designed to monetize pain." Maya who believed in creating things of value even if no one else ever saw them.

I'm remembering our last real conversation, before the livestream, before the meme. How disappointed she was in the person I was becoming.

*"Not whatever you're becoming,"* she had said, her eyes sad as she looked at me.

And what am I becoming now? Someone who would invade another person's privacy, expose their entire life, potentially destroy their family—all in the name of justice? Is that so different from what Avery did to Maya? Using someone's private moments as weapons, turning pain into spectacle?

"Casey." Dex's voice cuts through my thoughts. "Now or never."

I look at him, really look at him for the first time. The cold calculation in his eyes. The satisfaction as he prepares to destroy someone completely. Is this what I want? Is this who I want to be?

"No," I say, the word surprising even me as it leaves my mouth.

"No?" Dex repeats, his eyebrows shooting up. "What do you mean, no?"

"I mean no." I stand up, putting physical distance between myself and the destruction he's offering. "Don't do it. Don't release anything."

"Are you serious right now?" His face darkens with disbelief. "After everything I showed you? After what Avery did to Maya?"

"This isn't the answer," I say, the certainty growing even as I speak the words. "This is just... more of the same. More cruelty. More weaponized information. More pain as entertainment."

"This is justice," Dex counters, standing now too, his tall frame tense with anger. "This is consequences for actions."

"No." I shake my head. "This is revenge. And revenge doesn't fix anything. It just creates more victims, more pain, more engagement for a system that feeds on conflict."

Dex stares at me, a muscle in his jaw twitching. "So what, we just let her get away with it? Let her continue building her brand on Maya's suffering? Let her use Maya's disappearance as content for her Digital Wellness bullshit?"

The question is fair. What is the alternative? Let Avery continue unchecked, unaccountable? Let the system that rewarded her cruelty remain unchallenged?

And then, like a light breaking through fog, I remember what Ms. Santos said months ago, when I first started my documentary:

*"The most powerful thing you can do in a world of noise is to create a clear signal. Not by shouting louder, but by cutting through the distortion with truth."*

"I'm going to finish my documentary," I say, the words feeling right as they form. "Not just about digital inequality anymore, but about what happened to Maya. About the system that rewarded cruelty and punished vulnerability. About platforms designed to amplify pain. About institutions that protect reputation over justice."

Dex laughs, a short, bitter sound. "A documentary? That's your solution? While Maya is missing, while Avery is out there planning her next move, you want to make a film?"

"Yes." The certainty in my voice surprises even me. "Because that's what Maya would want. That's what I started before all of this—a way to expose the system, not just punish one person within it."

"That's naive bullshit," Dex spits. "Your documentary won't change anything. It won't hurt Avery. It won't fix the system. It's just going to make you feel better about yourself while the people with power keep winning."

His words sting because there's truth in them. A documentary won't bring immediate consequences. It won't guarantee justice. It won't fix everything that's broken.

"Maybe you're right," I concede. "Maybe it won't change everything. But it's the right thing to do. The only thing I can do without becoming exactly what I'm fighting against."

Dex stares at me for a long moment, his expression hardening into something cold and distant. "Then you're on your own," he says finally. "Don't come crawling back when your way fails. Don't ask for my help when Avery spins this into another win for her brand."

The dismissal stings, but I hold my ground. "I won't. But Dex—" I hesitate, knowing what I'm about to ask might be futile. "Please don't go ahead with your plan. Not without me. Not like this."

"Why shouldn't I?" he challenges. "You've made your choice. Why shouldn't I make mine?"

"Because it won't help Maya," I say simply. "It will just create more noise in a world that's already too loud. More pain in a situation that's already painful enough."

Something flickers across his face—doubt, perhaps, or a moment of recognition. But it's quickly replaced by the cold mask I've come to know.

"Get out," he says, turning back to his screens. "I need to think."

It's not a promise to stand down, but it's not an immediate rejection either. It's the best I can hope for right now.

"Thank you," I say quietly, already moving toward the door. "For showing me what Avery did. For trying to help in your way."

He doesn't respond, his back to me, shoulders rigid with tension or anger or both. I slip out of The Node and into the rain, the sudden downpour soaking me within seconds. But I don't run for cover. Instead, I stand there, face tilted up to the sky, letting the cold water wash over me.

For the first time in days, I feel clean. Clear. Certain.

Maya wouldn't want revenge. She wouldn't want more pain, more spectacle, more engagement with a system she'd already rejected. She would want truth. Context. A signal through the noise.

My phone is already waterlogged, but I pull it out anyway, texting Jordan with numb fingers:

**Me:** I didn't do it. You were right. Meeting at the News Lab tomorrow morning?

His response comes quickly:

**Jordan:** I'll be there. Bring your camera. We have work to do.

A simple acknowledgment, but it feels like a lifeline thrown across churning waters. I'm not alone in this. There are people who believe in the same things I do, who want to fight the right battles in the right ways.

I start walking, not toward the Restrepo house where the search for Maya continues, but toward home. I need to gather my equipment, my notes, my original footage. I need to start rebuilding what Avery destroyed—not just my documentary, but my sense of purpose, my moral compass.

The rain eases slightly as I walk, the worst of the downpour passing. My clothes are soaked through, my hair plastered to my skull, but I barely notice the discomfort. My mind is already racing ahead, planning, structuring, seeing the path forward with sudden clarity.

This documentary won't just be about digital inequality anymore. It will be about Maya—her story, her art, her voice. It will be about what happened when that voice was stolen, manipulated, weaponized. It will be about a system that rewards the loudest, cruelest voices while silencing those with something real to say.

It will be the story I was always meant to tell, but with a urgency and personal connection I couldn't have imagined when I started.

At home, I change into dry clothes and gather my equipment—camera, laptop, external drive, notebooks. Everything I need to start again, to build something true from the wreckage of the past weeks.

As I work, my phone buzzes with updates from the search for Maya. Still no sign of her at any of her usual places. Mr. Restrepo is getting closer to Crystal Lake but won't arrive for another hour. The police have expanded their alert to neighboring counties.

Each update tightens the knot of worry in my chest. Maya is still missing. She's still in pain, still vulnerable. My decision not to pursue revenge against Avery doesn't change that reality.

But it does change how I respond to it. Instead of adding to the noise, to the cruelty, to the weaponization of private pain, I can create something that honors Maya's voice. Something that might, in some small way, help ensure this doesn't happen to someone else.

I set up my camera on my desk, adjust the frame, check the lighting. Then, for the first time since this nightmare began, I turn the lens on myself. Not hiding behind it, not using it as a shield, but facing it directly.

I press record and take a deep breath.

"My name is Casey Morales," I say, looking straight into the lens. "This is the story of what happened when the system decided whose voices matter. This is the story of my best friend, Maya Restrepo, whose vulnerability was weaponized for clicks and shares. This is the story of platforms designed to amplify cruelty. This is the story of institutions that protected reputation over people."

The words flow more easily than I expected, driven by a clarity I haven't felt in weeks. This is right. This is necessary. This is what Maya would want.

"I started this documentary to expose digital inequality—how algorithms and platforms determine whose stories get heard and whose get buried. I didn't know then that my own work would be stolen, that my best friend would become the perfect case study in how the system fails those it claims to serve."

As I speak, I feel something shift inside me—a weight lifting, a fog clearing. The anger is still there, the grief for what Maya has endured, the worry about where she is now. But alongside these emotions is something new: purpose. Direction. A path forward that doesn't require becoming what I hate.

"This isn't just Maya's story," I continue, my voice growing stronger. "It's all of our story. It's about what we value, what we amplify, what we're willing to sacrifice for engagement. It's about the real cost of treating human experiences as content to be consumed."

I record for nearly thirty minutes, laying out the framework of what this documentary will become. When I finally stop, my throat is dry and my eyes are burning, but there's a sense of rightness that's been missing for too long.

This is how I fight back. Not with Dex's scorched-earth tactics, but with truth. With context. With a clear signal through the noise.

My phone rings—Mrs. Restrepo. I answer immediately, heart in my throat.

"Casey," she says, her voice tight with emotion. "They found her. She's at the cabin."

Relief floods through me so intensely I have to sit down. "Is she okay?"

"Physically, yes," Mrs. Restrepo says carefully. "Emotionally... it's complicated. She's been alone up there for almost two days. But she's safe. Miguel is with her now."

"Is she coming home?" I ask, almost afraid of the answer.

There's a pause on the other end. "Not yet. She's... resistant. She says she can't face coming back yet. Miguel is staying with her for now, trying to convince her."

The news is both a relief and a fresh wound. Maya is alive, safe, but still in so much pain she can't bear returning to her life. The damage Avery inflicted runs deep, possibly deeper than I've understood until now.

"Tell her—" I start, then stop, uncertain what message could possibly help. "Tell her I'm thinking of her. That I'm sorry. That I'm trying to fix this."

"I will," Mrs. Restrepo promises. "And Casey? Thank you. For helping find her."

After we hang up, I sit in the silence of my room, the relief of Maya being found mingling with the knowledge that being found isn't the same as being okay. She's still hiding from a world that turned her pain into entertainment, still trying to erase herself from a system that exploited her vulnerability.

But now, at least, I have a way forward. A purpose that honors Maya rather than exploiting her pain further. A path that might, eventually, help create the change we both wanted from the beginning.

I turn back to my camera, still set up on my desk, and press record again.

"Update," I say, my voice steadier now. "Maya has been found. She's physically safe but still in pain, still hiding from a world that hurt her. This documentary is for her now. This is how I keep my promise to tell the truth about what happened. This is how I fight back without becoming what I'm fighting against."

As I speak the words, I feel their truth settle into my bones. This is the choice I'm making—not revenge, not destruction, but creation. Building something meaningful from the wreckage of what's happened.

It won't fix everything. It won't undo the harm Avery has caused. It won't immediately change the systems that enabled that harm.

But it's a start. A signal through the noise. A step toward the person I want to be, not the person anger and fear were pushing me to become.

I turn off the camera and begin organizing my notes, my footage, my thoughts. Tomorrow, with Jordan and the Debuggers, we'll start building something true. Something necessary. Something Maya would be proud of.

Outside, the rain has stopped completely, leaving the world washed clean, at least for now. Through my window, I can see a thin slice of clearing sky, the first stars appearing as darkness falls.

Maya is out there somewhere, looking at the same sky. Alive. Safe, if not yet okay.

And I'm here, finally clear about the path forward.

Not revenge. Not more noise. But a signal. A voice. A truth that needs telling.

For Maya. For myself. For whatever comes next.

# Chapter 17

# CHAPTER 17

The News Lab is empty when I arrive the next morning. School doesn't officially start for another hour, but Ms. Santos gave me her spare key months ago—a gesture of trust I've never taken lightly.

"For those early morning inspirations," she'd said, pressing the cool metal into my palm. "Just promise you'll use it for good, not evil."

At the time, we'd both laughed. Now, the memory sits heavy in my chest as I flip on the lights and survey the chaotic creative space that's been my second home since freshman year. The jumble of equipment, the wall of abandoned student projects, the faded journalism posters—it all feels both achingly familiar and somehow different, as if I'm seeing it through new eyes.

Or maybe I'm the one who's different.

I set my backpack on the editing desk and power up the main computer. My camera comes next, connected via cable to upload the footage I recorded last night—my new introduction, my renewed purpose. The raw, unfiltered truth of what happened to Maya.

Maya. 

My phone shows no new messages from the Restrepos. The last update, sent late last night, was brief but reassuring: she's still at the cabin with her father, still refusing to come home, but talking more, eating a little. Small victories in a war that shouldn't be happening at all.

The door creaks open behind me, and I turn to find Ms. Santos in the doorway, two coffee cups in hand.

"Thought you might need this," she says, offering me one. "Jordan texted that you'd be here early."

I accept the cup gratefully, the warmth seeping into my cold fingers. "Thank you."

Ms. Santos sets her bag down and leans against the desk, studying me. Her gaze is gentle but penetrating, taking in the dark circles under my eyes, the tension in my shoulders.

"You look better," she says finally.

I raise an eyebrow. "Better than what?"

"Better than someone about to burn the world down." She sips her coffee, eyes never leaving mine. "Jordan filled me in. About your friend Dex. About what you chose not to do."

My stomach tightens. How much does she know? How much did Jordan tell her?

"Don't worry," she says, reading my expression. "He was appropriately vague about the specifics. Just said you were offered a destructive path and chose a constructive one instead."

The tension in my shoulders eases slightly. "That's one way to put it."

"So." Ms. Santos straightens, her demeanor shifting from concerned mentor to focused ally. "Tell me about this documentary. The new version."

I take a deep breath, organizing my thoughts. This moment feels pivotal somehow—the first time I'm articulating my vision to someone who can actually help make it real.

"It's still about digital inequality," I begin, "but now it's more specific. More urgent. It's Maya's story, but it's also the story of the system that allowed what happened to her. The platforms that reward cruelty. The algorithms that amplify pain. The institutions that protect reputation over people."

Ms. Santos nods, her expression thoughtful. "A case study in systemic failure."

"Exactly. Not just about Avery stealing my footage—though that's where it starts—but about everything that followed. How a private moment became public entertainment. How harassment became engagement. How vulnerability became content."

"And the goal?" she asks, cutting to the heart of the matter. "What do you want this film to accomplish?"

The question stops me short. What do I want? Justice for Maya seems too simple, too personal. Exposing Avery feels insufficient, too focused on a single bad actor in a broken system. Changing how platforms work is wildly ambitious, maybe impossible.

"I want people to see the real cost," I say finally. "Not just for Maya, but for all of us. What we lose when human experience becomes something to be consumed. What happens when we value engagement over empathy."

Ms. Santos is quiet for a long moment, considering my words. Then she nods, a slow, deliberate movement. "That's a documentary worth making." She sets her coffee down. "What do you need from me?"

The direct offer of support brings a lump to my throat. "Access to the school's equipment. Time in the News Lab. Maybe..." I hesitate, knowing what I'm about to ask is a big request. "Maybe permission to screen it here when it's done. For the community."

Her eyebrows rise slightly. "A public screening? Here at North Point?"

"Yes. Not just for students, but parents, teachers, community members. The people who need to see what happened, to understand their role in it—even if that role was just scrolling past and doing nothing."

Ms. Santos walks to the window, looking out at the empty school grounds. The morning sun casts long shadows across the quad, the world still quiet before the day begins in earnest.

"Principal Davis won't like it," she says, her back to me.

"I know."

"The Liangs will push back. Hard."

"I know that too."

She turns, and to my surprise, she's smiling—a small, fierce expression that reminds me why I trusted her with my documentary in the first place.

"Good thing the Cultural Arts Committee doesn't need administrative approval for student showcases." She taps her chest. "Committee chair, three years running. We have our own budget, our own calendar, and our own authority to approve content."

Relief and gratitude wash over me. "So you'll help?"

"With conditions." Her expression turns serious again. "This has to be about more than personal grievance, Casey. More than exposing Avery or seeking justice for Maya—as justified as those feelings are. If this is going to work, it has to illuminate the system, not just the individuals within it."

"That's exactly what I want," I assure her. "I promise."

"And you'll need to be prepared for pushback. Not just from Avery and her crowd, but from people who don't want to see their own complicity. From platforms that profit from exactly what you're critiquing. From a school system that values reputation over accountability."

The reality of what I'm taking on settles heavy on my shoulders. This won't be easy. It might not even be safe. But it's necessary in a way nothing else has ever been.

"I'm prepared," I say, and I mean it.

Ms. Santos studies me for another moment, then nods decisively. "Then let's do this. I'll book the auditorium for two weeks from Saturday. That gives you enough time to finish the film but not so much that the momentum fades."

"Two weeks," I repeat, mentally calculating what needs to be done. It's ambitious but doable. With help.

As if on cue, the door opens again, and Jordan steps in, followed by the core Debuggers—Lia, Trent, and the Kim twins. They're carrying laptops, notebooks, and what looks like several external hard drives.

"Sorry we're late," Jordan says, setting his equipment on a nearby desk. "We wanted to make sure we had everything."

Ms. Santos looks at the assembled group, her expression approving. "I'll leave you to it. Let me know what resources you need." She heads for the door, pausing with her hand on the knob. "And Casey? I'm proud of you."

The simple statement hits me harder than I expected, bringing a fresh wave of emotion I quickly swallow down. "Thank you."

After she leaves, I turn to the group, suddenly aware that I'm effectively asking them to join me in what could become a very public, very controversial project. "I should explain what I'm planning. You all deserve to know what you're getting into."

"We know," Trent says, already unpacking his laptop.

"Jordan filled us in," Lia adds, pushing her glasses up. "We're in. All the way."

I look at Jordan, a question in my eyes. How much did he tell them? About Dex? About what I almost did?

"Just the documentary," he says quietly, answering my unspoken concern. "Your decision. Your vision. Nothing else."

The relief must show on my face, because he smiles, a small, private expression meant only for me. "Some things are just between us."

Something warm unfurls in my chest at his words. Not just the reassurance about discretion, but the implication of an "us"—a partnership, an alliance, perhaps something more.

I clear my throat, pushing those thoughts aside for now. "Okay, so the plan. Two weeks to finish the documentary and prepare for a community screening here at school. Ms. Santos is going to book the auditorium through the Cultural Arts Committee."

"Two weeks is tight," Sara Kim observes, already opening a project management app on her tablet. "We'll need to split up tasks."

"And prepare for resistance," her twin adds. "Avery's not going to let this happen without a fight."

"That's why I need your help," I acknowledge. "Not just with the technical aspects, but with protection. Digital security. Evidence preservation."

Lia's eyes light up at the challenge. "I can build a secure cloud storage system for all the footage and documents. Something Avery and her friends can't access or tamper with."

"And we can document any attempts to interfere," Trent offers. "Create a paper trail of obstruction."

"I'll handle social media strategy," Jordan says. "How we promote the screening without tipping our hand too early. How we frame it to get the right people there."

The twins exchange a glance, having one of their silent communications, before Simon speaks. "We'll work on the technical setup for the screening itself. Making sure the equipment can't be sabotaged, that we have backups for everything."

As they continue discussing logistics, dividing responsibilities, and building a timeline, I feel something I haven't experienced in weeks: hope. Not the desperate, frantic energy that drove me to Dex's server room, but something steadier. More sustainable. The quiet certainty of people working together toward something that matters.

"What about Maya?" Lia asks, her voice gentle. "Will she be part of this?"

The question brings me back to the central, painful reality at the heart of everything we're doing. Maya, still hiding at that remote cabin. Maya, whose voice was stolen, weaponized, then silenced.

"I don't know," I admit. "She's still... not ready to come back. Not ready to face any of this." I swallow hard. "But this is for her, whether she's there or not. This is about making sure what happened to her doesn't happen to someone else."

Jordan places a hand on my shoulder, a simple gesture of support that anchors me. "We should build in protections for her regardless. Ways to tell her story without exposing her to more attention if she doesn't want it."

"Yes," I agree immediately. "No new footage of her unless she explicitly consents. No details about where she is now. No speculation about her current state."

Trent nods, making notes. "We focus on the system, not the victim. On the mechanics of how this happened, not the personal impact."

"Exactly." I feel a surge of gratitude for how quickly they understand, how effortlessly they align with the ethical approach I want to take. "This isn't about exploiting Maya's pain. It's about exposing the system that caused it."

The first bell rings, signaling twenty minutes until classes begin. We look at each other, the reality of our ordinary school lives momentarily intruding on the important work before us.

"Lunch meeting?" Jordan suggests. "And after school? We can map out the full project then."

Everyone nods, gathering their things but leaving the equipment set up in the News Lab—our base of operations for the coming weeks.

As the others file out to head to their homerooms, Jordan lingers, waiting until we're alone.

"You okay?" he asks, his voice soft.

The simple question catches me off guard. Everyone's been so focused on the project, on Maya, on the logistics of what we're trying to accomplish that no one—not even my mom—has asked how I'm actually doing.

"I don't know," I answer honestly. "I'm... functional. Focused. That's enough for now."

Jordan studies my face, concern evident in his eyes. "And Dex? Has he—"

"Radio silence since yesterday." I try to keep my voice neutral, not betraying the anxiety that silence provokes. Is Dex respecting my decision? Or is he proceeding with his own plans, regardless of what I chose? "I'm trying not to think about it."

"If he does anything—"

"I'll tell you," I promise. "No more secrets. No more trying to handle everything alone."

Jordan nods, relieved. "Good." He hesitates, then adds, "You know, the documentary is important. But so are you. Your well-being matters too."

Something in his tone—the genuine concern, the specific care for me beyond my function in our shared mission—brings a flush to my cheeks. "I'll remember that."

"See that you do," he says, the corner of his mouth lifting in a half-smile. "See you at lunch?"

"I'll be there."

After he leaves, I gather my own things, preparing to head to first period. The day stretches ahead—ordinary classes, ordinary interactions, the mundane rhythm of high school continuing despite everything else happening in our lives.

But beneath that ordinary surface, something important has begun. A documentary that might actually matter. A truth that needs telling. A signal cutting through the noise.

And for the first time since Maya's livestream breakdown, I feel like I'm moving toward something rather than just running from the aftermath of disaster.

---

The day passes in a blur of classes, conversations, and clandestine planning. At lunch, the Debuggers and I claim a corner table in the cafeteria, laptops open, voices low as we continue mapping out the documentary project. By the time the final bell rings, we have a comprehensive plan—a structure for the film, a division of labor for the coming weeks, and a strategy for the community screening.

What we don't have is enough time. Even with six of us working together, the scale of what we're attempting in just two weeks is daunting.

"We'll need to work nights," Jordan says as we reconvene in the News Lab after school. "Weekends too."

"I can do tonight," I offer. "And every night, really. This is my priority."

"I can stay late today and tomorrow," Lia says, checking her calendar. "Debate team on Thursday, though."

"I'm free Thursday," Trent counters. "But I've got family stuff this weekend."

The twins compare schedules, working out a rotation that ensures at least two people are always available to help. Ms. Santos stops by briefly, dropping off permission forms for equipment use and officially booking the auditorium for our screening.

"Cultural Arts Showcase," she explains, showing me the event listing. "Technically accurate, strategically vague."

The afternoon stretches into evening as we begin the real work. I upload all my original documentary footage—what Avery didn't steal—along with the new material I've been shooting. Lia sets up a secure cloud server, protected by what she assures me are "state-of-the-art encryptions." Trent begins organizing the evidence of harassment we've collected—screenshots, archived posts, platform policies that were violated and ignored.

"This is good," Jordan says, reviewing what we've assembled so far. "But we need more. Personal testimonies from other students affected by the system. Expert perspectives on how platforms profit from engagement regardless of content. Context for why this matters beyond our school."

He's right. A documentary centered solely on Maya's experience might be powerful, but it could be dismissed as a personal grievance. We need to show the pattern, the broader implications, the systemic nature of the problem.

"My mom offered to speak about tech labor," I remember. "The service economy that underlies these platforms."

"Perfect," Jordan nods. "And I have a contact at State University who researches algorithmic bias. She could provide the academic perspective."

One by one, the pieces come together. A structure emerges—not just Maya's story, but a broader examination of how digital platforms shape whose voices matter, how attention becomes currency, how vulnerability becomes content.

The News Lab empties gradually as evening deepens. Lia leaves first, called home for dinner. The twins follow an hour later, promising to return tomorrow with additional equipment. Trent stays until nearly eight, helping me organize interview questions for potential subjects.

And then it's just Jordan and me, surrounded by the remnants of the day's work—open laptops, scattered notes, half-empty coffee cups.

"You should go home," I tell him, noticing the fatigue in his eyes. "Get some rest. We've got two more weeks of this."

"I'm fine," he insists, though he can't quite suppress a yawn. "Besides, someone should stay with you. For safety, if nothing else."

The concern warms me, even as I wave it off. "I'm perfectly safe in the News Lab. Ms. Santos will lock up when she leaves, and she's here until at least nine preparing for tomorrow's classes."

Jordan gives me a skeptical look. "And when was the last time you took a break? Ate something? Remembered you're human?"

I open my mouth to protest, then realize I can't actually remember eating anything since the granola bar I had at lunch. My stomach chooses that moment to growl audibly, betraying me.

Jordan grins triumphantly. "That's what I thought. Come on, there's a vending machine in the staff lounge. Ms. Santos gave me her key."

"Vending machine dinner. How glamorous," I say dryly, but I follow him anyway, my body suddenly reminding me of all its neglected needs.

The empty hallways feel eerie at this hour, our footsteps echoing against metal lockers and polished floors. North Point High transforms after hours, the fluorescent lights casting strange shadows, the absence of teenage chaos creating an almost liminal space.

"It's weird, isn't it?" Jordan says quietly as we walk. "Being here when everyone's gone. Seeing the stage without the performers."

"Like seeing the system without the noise," I agree, understanding exactly what he means. "The structure that shapes everything, normally hidden by activity."

He glances at me, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. "Yes. Exactly that."

We reach the staff lounge, a forbidden territory during school hours now accessible thanks to Ms. Santos's trust. Jordan unlocks the door, flipping on the lights to reveal a space that's surprisingly ordinary—a few worn couches, a coffee machine, the promised vending machine humming in the corner.

"What's your poison?" Jordan asks, fishing quarters from his pocket. "Chips? Chocolate? The mysterious 'cheese-flavored snack product' in row C?"

"Surprise me," I say, sinking onto one of the couches. The exhaustion I've been fighting all day catches up at once, my body heavy against the cushions.

Jordan returns with an armful of snacks—chips, cookies, granola bars, and two bottles of water. "Balanced meal," he says, dumping the haul on the coffee table between us.

"Very nutritious," I agree, reaching for a package of cookies. "My mom would be horrified."

"Speaking of which, does she know you're still here? Working this late?"

I nod, mouth full of chocolate chip cookie. "Texted her earlier. She's on a late shift at Solas anyway."

Jordan opens his own snack, something salty and neon-orange that leaves dust on his fingers. For a few minutes, we eat in companionable silence, the simple act of satisfying hunger taking precedence over conversation.

"Can I ask you something?" he says finally, his tone shifting to something more serious.

I brace myself, unsure what's coming. "Sure."

"Why did you choose this path? The documentary, I mean. When Dex offered you... the other option."

The question isn't what I expected, and I take a moment to consider my answer. Not the simplified version I've been telling myself and others, but the complex truth.

"I almost didn't," I admit, looking down at the cookie crumbs on my lap. "When Dex showed me what Avery had done—the Discord servers, the coordinated harassment, how she celebrated Maya's breakdown—I wanted to destroy her. I really did. I was one keystroke away from letting Dex release everything."

Jordan nods, not judging, just listening.

"But then I realized that would make me just like her. Using someone's private information as a weapon. Turning pain into spectacle. Feeding the same system that hurt Maya in the first place." I look up, meeting his eyes. "And I remembered why I started my documentary in the first place. Not to tear people down, but to expose the structures that determine whose voices matter. To create something that might actually change how people see."

Jordan is quiet for a long moment, considering my words. "That's... a hard choice to make. When you're angry. When someone you care about is hurting."

"It wasn't entirely noble," I confess. "Part of me still wants Avery to pay for what she did. Part of me is hoping this documentary will expose her anyway, just... in a different way."

"That's human," Jordan says simply. "Wanting justice isn't wrong. It's the how that matters."

The understanding in his voice touches something deep inside me—a recognition that moral choices aren't always clean or easy, that doing the right thing doesn't mean you don't still feel the pull of the wrong thing.

"What about you?" I ask, turning the question back on him. "Why are you helping me with this? You barely know Maya. This isn't your fight."

Jordan sets down his snack, wiping orange dust from his fingers with careful deliberation. "Maybe it should be everyone's fight," he says finally. "When the system rewards cruelty and punishes vulnerability. When platforms profit from pain." He looks up, his eyes serious. "But if you want the specific reason, it's because I've watched you since freshman year. In Ms. Santos's class. Working on your documentaries. Caring about things most people ignore."

I feel heat rise to my cheeks, unsure how to respond to this unexpected revelation.

"You've always tried to shine light on the invisible barriers," he continues. "The things most people don't see or choose not to see. That matters. Especially now."

The simple validation—of my work, my purpose, the things I care about—brings a lump to my throat. "Thank you," I manage, my voice slightly hoarse. "For seeing that. For helping."

"She would be proud of you," Jordan says quietly. "Maya, I mean. Of what you're doing now. Of the choice you made."

The words hit me with unexpected force, bringing tears to my eyes that I quickly blink away. Would Maya be proud? Or would she still see me as part of the problem, the one who involved her in this disaster in the first place?

"I hope so," I whisper. "I really hope so."

Jordan reaches across the table, covering my hand with his. The touch is warm, steady, grounding. "She will be. When she's ready. When she can see clearly again."

We sit like that for a long moment, connected by touch and shared purpose and something else I'm not quite ready to name. The fluorescent lights hum overhead, the vending machine cycles with a mechanical click, and outside, the world continues its chaotic spin.

But here, in this quiet moment, there's a clarity I haven't felt in weeks. A certainty about the path forward, about the story that needs telling, about the signal I'm trying to send through all the noise.

For Maya. For myself. For everyone caught in a system designed to amplify the wrong things.

"We should get back to work," I say finally, though I make no move to withdraw my hand from his.

Jordan nods, giving my fingers a gentle squeeze before letting go. "Lead the way, documentary maker."

As we gather our snack wrappers and head back to the News Lab, I feel something shift between us—a deepening of trust, of understanding, of shared purpose. Not just allies in a cause, but something more. Something with potential beyond the immediate crisis.

For the first time since this nightmare began, I find myself thinking not just about what I'm fighting against, but what I might be building. Not just exposing a broken system, but creating connections that matter. Not just sending a signal through the noise, but finding people who are listening for it.

And somehow, that makes all the difference.

# Chapter 18

# CHAPTER 18

The documentary is taking shape.

For five days straight, we've worked around the clock. The News Lab has transformed into our war room—whiteboards covered in timelines, editing stations running day and night, a constant cycle of coffee cups and takeout containers marking the passage of time. The Kim twins set up an actual cot in the equipment closet so we can take shifts sleeping between editing sessions.

Ms. Santos occasionally appears with actual food—"Bodies need nutrients, not just caffeine"—and checks our progress, offering guidance when we need it but mostly letting us work. My mom has contributed too, sitting for a powerful interview about tech labor and bringing homemade empanadas to fuel our marathon sessions.

"You were right about the structure," Jordan says, reviewing our latest cut. We're alone in the lab, the others having gone home for a few hours of real sleep. "Starting with Maya's interview, then showing how it was stolen and weaponized—it's devastating."

I nod, watching the footage where Maya speaks candidly about why she stopped posting her art online. Her voice is clear, passionate despite her anxiety, believing in something better than what the platforms offer. The contrast with what came after—the theft, the livestream, the meme—creates exactly the emotional impact I was hoping for.

"It's still missing something, though," I say, chewing absently on a pen cap. "Something that connects it to the broader pattern."

"The expert interviews help," Jordan points out. "Especially the algorithm researcher. And the testimonials from other students who've experienced similar harassment."

"But it still feels too... isolated. Like it could be dismissed as one bad incident, one bad actor."

Jordan leans back in his chair, considering. "What about Avery's Digital Wellness Initiative? Her complete pivot from causing the problem to selling herself as the solution? That's the system in a nutshell—rewarding the person who created the crisis for pretending to fix it."

"Perfect," I say, already mentally reshaping the final act of the documentary. "We need footage from her most recent posts about it. And maybe from that assembly she did yesterday."

"On it." Jordan pulls out his phone, navigating to Avery's InstaFrame profile. His expression changes as he scrolls, a frown deepening between his brows.

"What is it?" I ask, moving to look over his shoulder.

"Her latest post. From twenty minutes ago." He angles the screen so I can see.

It's a perfectly composed image of Avery in the school auditorium, surrounded by poster boards with slogans like "Digital Citizenship Matters" and "Be Kind Online." Her caption makes my stomach twist:

*SO excited to announce our Digital Wellness Initiative will be hosting a special workshop on Saturday, May 15 in the North Point High auditorium! We'll be discussing healthy online habits, cyberbullying prevention, and how to create a safer digital community. Principal Davis will be speaking, along with a child psychologist and yours truly! #DigitalWellnessNow #NorthPointCares*

"That's our date," I say, the implications sinking in. "She booked the auditorium for the same day as our screening."

"How did she know?" Jordan asks, his voice tight with suspicion.

"I don't know. Maybe she saw the Cultural Arts Committee calendar? Or someone in the administration told her?" I scroll through the comments, noting the enthusiastic responses, the praise for Avery's "leadership" on this important issue. "Look at the time stamp. She posted this right after Ms. Santos officially booked the auditorium for us."

Jordan's frown deepens. "This isn't a coincidence. She's deliberately blocking us."

"And using the very issue she caused as her shield," I add, anger bubbling up beneath my initial shock. "She's weaponizing 'digital wellness' to silence the truth about what she did."

"What do we do?" Jordan looks to me, and I realize that somehow, in the chaos of the past week, I've become the leader of this makeshift team. The one people turn to for decisions, for direction.

I straighten, pushing down the flutter of panic that comes with that responsibility. "We talk to Ms. Santos. First thing tomorrow. If Avery can get the auditorium, we'll find somewhere else. A community center. The public library. Somewhere."

Jordan nods, but I can see the worry behind his eyes. It's not just about the venue. It's about what this means—that Avery knows what we're planning, that she's already moving to counter us, that this won't be as simple as we hoped.

"We should warn the others," he says, already texting the group. "And maybe beef up our security measures. If she knows about the screening, she might try to access our footage too."

The thought sends a chill through me. All our work, all our evidence, vulnerable to the same theft that started this whole mess. "Lia said her cloud setup was secure, right?"

"Secure, yes. But nothing's unhackable if someone's determined enough." Jordan finishes his text to the team, then turns to me fully. "Casey, we need to be prepared. This is just the first move. If Avery's fighting back, it's going to get worse before it gets better."

He's right, of course. Avery has power, influence, resources. She has her family's wealth behind her, the school administration's tacit support, and a carefully cultivated public image as a mental health advocate. What do we have? A handful of determined students, one supportive teacher, and the truth—which, as we've already seen, isn't always enough in a world that values engagement over accuracy.

"We keep going," I say, my resolve hardening despite the obstacles ahead. "We finish the documentary. We find a venue. We tell the truth, no matter what."

Jordan's expression softens, something like pride mixing with concern in his eyes. "Okay. Then let's get back to work."

We stay until nearly midnight, reorganizing the documentary structure to include Avery's Digital Wellness pivot, securing our footage with additional passwords, and making contingency plans for alternative screening venues. By the time we leave, the situation feels less like a crisis and more like a challenge—difficult, but not insurmountable.

What we don't realize is that Avery's post was just the opening move in a much larger campaign to silence us.

---

The next morning, I arrive at school to find Ms. Santos waiting outside the News Lab, her expression grim.

"Principal Davis wants to see you," she says without preamble. "Your mother too. His office, 8:15."

My heart sinks. "About the screening?"

"Among other things." Ms. Santos glances around to ensure no one is listening, then lowers her voice. "The Liangs called him last night. Made some... insinuations about the nature of your project."

"What kind of insinuations?"

"That it constitutes harassment of Avery. That it's motivated by personal grievance, not journalistic integrity." She places a hand on my shoulder, steady and reassuring. "I'll be there with you. Just stick to the facts. This is about systemic issues, not personal attacks."

I nod, though my stomach churns with anxiety. "I'll text my mom. She's supposed to be at work by 8, but maybe she can be late."

"Do that. And Casey—" Ms. Santos's expression softens slightly. "Remember why you're doing this. Not for revenge. For truth."

The reminder steadies me. "For truth," I echo.

Mom arrives at 8:10, still in her Solas cafeteria uniform, her face tight with worry. "What's this about, Casey? I had to tell my supervisor it was a family emergency."

"It's about the documentary," I explain quickly as we walk toward the principal's office. "Avery's family found out and they're trying to shut us down."

Mom's expression hardens. "Let them try."

Her immediate support, unwavering and fierce, gives me courage as we enter Principal Davis's office. He sits behind his desk, looking uncomfortable but determined. Ms. Santos is already there, her posture professional but with a hint of defiance in the set of her shoulders.

"Mrs. Morales, Casey," Principal Davis says, gesturing to the chairs across from him. "Thank you for coming on such short notice. We have a... situation that needs addressing."

"Regarding?" Mom asks, her voice cool and collected despite the early hour and rushed arrival.

"Regarding a proposed screening that Ms. Santos has scheduled through the Cultural Arts Committee." He shuffles some papers on his desk, not quite meeting our eyes. "It has come to my attention that this event may be problematic in nature."

"Problematic how?" I ask, keeping my voice as neutral as possible.

Principal Davis clears his throat. "The Liang family has expressed concerns that the content may constitute harassment or defamation of their daughter. They've provided examples of social media posts from students involved in the project that suggest an... agenda."

"What posts?" I demand, surprised. None of us have posted anything about the documentary online. We've been deliberately quiet about it, knowing Avery would try to stop us if she found out.

He slides a printout across the desk. It shows screenshots of messages—allegedly from Jordan, Lia, and me—discussing plans to "take down" Avery, to "expose her lies," to "make her pay." The messages look authentic at first glance, with our profile pictures and usernames, but I immediately recognize them as fakes.

"These are fabricated," I say firmly. "None of us wrote these. Check the accounts—they're probably made hours ago."

"The timestamps indicate they're from last week," Principal Davis counters.

"They're fake," I insist. "We can prove it with the original accounts. This is exactly the kind of manipulation we're documenting—how easy it is to create false narratives online."

Principal Davis shifts uncomfortably. "Regardless of the authenticity of these particular messages, the Liangs have raised legitimate concerns about the nature of this screening. Using school facilities to target a specific student could be seen as enabling harassment."

"We're not targeting Avery," I argue, struggling to keep my voice level. "We're documenting what happened when my footage was stolen, when Maya was harassed, when the platforms failed to enforce their own policies. This is journalism, not revenge."

"Casey's documentary has educational value," Ms. Santos adds, her tone professional but firm. "It addresses digital citizenship, media literacy, and platform accountability—all topics relevant to our curriculum."

Principal Davis sighs, rubbing his temples. "I understand your position, Ms. Santos. But I also have to consider the school's liability. The Liangs have implied they would consider legal action if their daughter is portrayed in a negative light without her consent."

"Truth is an absolute defense against defamation," Mom says suddenly, surprising all of us with her legal knowledge. "If Casey's documentary presents factual information, backed by evidence, there's no legal basis for a complaint."

I glance at her, impressed and grateful for her unexpected expertise.

"Moreover," she continues, "suppressing this screening because of pressure from one wealthy family raises serious questions about equity and free speech at North Point High."

Principal Davis's expression tightens. "Mrs. Morales, I understand your concern for your daughter, but there are complex factors at play here. Including..." he hesitates, then pushes forward, "potential impacts on the employment situation of families connected to this matter."

The thinly veiled threat—that my mom's job at Solas could be at risk if we proceed—lands like a physical blow. I feel sick, torn between my commitment to the documentary and my fear of putting my mother's livelihood in jeopardy.

But before I can speak, Mom straightens in her chair, her expression resolute. "Are you implying that my job security should influence my daughter's academic freedom, Principal Davis?"

He backpedals quickly. "Not at all. I'm simply acknowledging the... interconnected nature of our community."

"Then let me be clear," Mom says, her voice quiet but steel-edged. "My daughter has evidence of serious ethical breaches—theft of intellectual property, coordinated online harassment, institutional failures to protect vulnerable students. Suppressing that evidence because of who was responsible would teach exactly the wrong lesson about justice and accountability."

Pride swells in my chest as I listen to her defend not just me, but the principles behind what we're doing. This is my mother—a woman who works long hours serving food to tech executives, who worries about making rent and paying for my college, who has every reason to be cautious—standing up to power because it's the right thing to do.

Principal Davis looks increasingly uncomfortable, caught between the Liangs' influence and the moral clarity of my mother's position. He turns to Ms. Santos, perhaps hoping for a compromise.

"Given these concerns, perhaps the screening could be modified? Made more general, less focused on specific individuals?"

"The documentary speaks to systemic issues," Ms. Santos responds evenly. "But it uses a specific case study to illustrate those issues—as any good journalism does. Removing that specificity would undermine its educational value."

"I see." Principal Davis taps his fingers on the desk, clearly searching for a solution that will appease all parties. "What if the screening were postponed? To allow time for all perspectives to be included?"

"Delay is effectively denial," I say, recognizing the tactic. "And we've already included multiple perspectives, including experts on algorithmic bias, platform governance, and digital ethics."

"Has Avery Liang been offered an opportunity to respond?" he asks.

The question gives me pause. We haven't approached Avery directly—partly because of our history, partly because we feared she would try to shut us down if she knew (fears that have now been validated).

"We've included her public statements," I say carefully. "Her social media posts, her Digital Wellness Initiative, her public response to Maya's situation."

"But not her direct response to your allegations," Principal Davis presses, sensing a procedural weakness.

Before I can respond, Ms. Santos interjects. "As the faculty advisor for this project, I'll ensure that Ms. Liang is given an appropriate opportunity to respond, should she wish to do so. That's standard journalistic practice."

It's a clever move—acknowledging the procedural concern while not compromising the documentary's integrity or timeline. Principal Davis seems momentarily mollified, but then his expression shifts again.

"There's one other matter," he says, pulling another document from his folder. "The auditorium reservation for May 15. It appears there's been a scheduling conflict."

"What conflict?" Ms. Santos asks sharply. "I submitted the Cultural Arts Committee request on Monday. It was approved yesterday."

"Yes, well." Principal Davis looks distinctly uncomfortable now. "It seems Ms. Liang had already been in discussions with the administration about using the space for her Digital Wellness Initiative. Her formal request came in after yours, but there was a... pre-existing understanding about the space."

"A pre-existing understanding," Ms. Santos repeats, her tone making it clear what she thinks of this sudden revelation. "Was this understanding documented anywhere? Entered into the reservation system?"

"Not formally, no," Principal Davis admits. "But given the sensitive nature of recent events and the positive community impact of Ms. Liang's initiative, the administration feels her event should take priority."

There it is—the real reason we've been called here. Not concern about defamation or harassment, but a straightforward power play. Avery's family has influence, and they're using it to ensure her narrative dominates, silencing any alternative perspective.

"That's unacceptable," Mom says, her voice tight with controlled anger. "The Cultural Arts Committee has independent authority over the auditorium for student showcases. You can't simply override that because a wealthy family prefers their daughter's event."

Principal Davis spreads his hands in a gesture of helplessness that fools no one. "I understand your frustration, Mrs. Morales. But the decision has been made. The administration feels Ms. Liang's event better serves the school community at this sensitive time."

I look to Ms. Santos, expecting her to fight harder, to assert the committee's authority. Instead, she nods slowly, her expression unreadable. "I see. Well, if that's the administration's position, we'll need to adjust our plans."

Her easy capitulation surprises me, but a warning glance tells me to follow her lead. "Fine," I say, though it costs me to concede even temporarily. "We'll find another venue."

"I'm glad we could reach an understanding," Principal Davis says, relief evident in his voice. "And regarding the content of the documentary itself, I would strongly encourage you to reconsider any elements that could be perceived as targeting Ms. Liang specifically."

"We'll take your concerns under advisement," Ms. Santos says neutrally, already standing to signal the end of the meeting.

As we file out of the office, the first bell rings, signaling five minutes until classes begin. Students flood the hallways, creating a buffer of noise and activity around us.

"What just happened?" I ask Ms. Santos once we're safely away from the principal's office. "Why did you give in so easily?"

She smiles, a small, subversive expression that transforms her face. "I didn't give in. I merely recognized when to stop arguing and start planning our countermove."

"Countermove?" Mom asks, still bristling from the confrontation.

"Principal Davis has the authority to reassign the auditorium, yes. But he doesn't have authority over how the student clubs use their allocated meeting spaces." Ms. Santos checks her watch. "Casey, get to class. We'll talk more at lunch. Mrs. Morales, thank you for your support. It means more than you know."

Mom gives me a quick hug. "I have to get to work. Call me later and tell me the plan." She lowers her voice. "And don't back down. What you're doing matters."

As she hurries toward the exit, I turn to Ms. Santos. "So we really do have a plan?"

"We will," she assures me. "The Debuggers club has a regular Friday meeting slot in the lecture hall, doesn't it? With A/V equipment already set up?"

Understanding dawns. "Yes. For their weekly tech talks."

"A lecture on digital ethics and platform accountability would certainly fall within their club mandate, wouldn't it?"

The brilliance of it makes me grin despite the seriousness of the situation. "It absolutely would."

"Get to class," Ms. Santos repeats, her own smile widening. "And tell Jordan to meet us in the News Lab at lunch. We have some adjusting to do."

As I hurry to first period, narrowly avoiding a tardy, my mind races with the implications of the morning's meeting. Avery knows about our documentary. She's actively working to silence it, using her family's influence to block our screening. And she's apparently created fake social media posts to paint us as vindictive, undermining our credibility before we even present our evidence.

It's intimidating, this flexing of power and privilege. But it's also validating—proof that what we're doing matters, that it has the potential to actually change something. You don't try to silence stories that don't threaten you.

By the time I reach English class, slipping into my seat just as the final bell rings, a new determination has settled over me. Avery may have money, influence, and institutional support. But we have something more powerful: the truth, documented and irrefutable. And we will find a way to make it heard, no matter what obstacles they put in our path.

The game has changed, the stakes raised. But we're not backing down. Not now. Not when we're so close to cutting through the noise with a signal that can't be ignored.

"They did WHAT?" Lia exclaims when I explain the situation at our emergency lunch meeting in the News Lab.

"Gave our auditorium slot to Avery's Digital Wellness event," I repeat. "And implied my mom's job could be at risk if we proceed with the documentary as planned."

"That's... that's corrupt," Trent says, his usual calm shattered by indignation. "They can't do that."

"They just did," Jordan points out grimly. "And the fake social media posts are concerning too. They're trying to discredit us before we even show the documentary."

The Kim twins exchange one of their silent communications, then Simon speaks. "We can prove those posts are fake. Metadata analysis, account creation dates, linguistic inconsistencies with our actual writing patterns."

"But that takes time," Sara adds. "Time we may not have if they're already moving against us this aggressively."

Ms. Santos, who has been listening quietly, finally speaks. "We need to adapt, not abandon. The documentary is too important to be silenced by these tactics."

"Agreed," I say firmly. "So what's the new plan? You mentioned the Debuggers' club meeting slot?"

Jordan catches on immediately. "Friday afternoon, lecture hall. We're scheduled for a two-hour block with full A/V setup." He turns to Ms. Santos. "Are you suggesting we use that for our screening?"

"Not a screening," she corrects carefully. "A club meeting focused on a case study in digital ethics. With visual aids."

The distinction is subtle but important—a documentary screening could be blocked, but a club using visual materials for educational purposes falls squarely within approved activities.

"We'd need to rebrand slightly," Lia says, already thinking through the logistics. "Position it as an educational discussion rather than a film premiere."

"And be prepared for Avery or the administration to try to shut it down anyway," Trent adds pragmatically.

"Which is why we need backup plans for the backup plan," I say, the pieces falling into place. "Digital distribution if the in-person event gets blocked. Multiple copies of the finished documentary in secure locations. Alternate venues if the lecture hall suddenly becomes 'unavailable.'"

Ms. Santos nods approvingly. "Now you're thinking like journalists in a hostile environment. Prepare for interference at every step."

"What about my mom?" I ask, the concern still gnawing at me. "The threat to her job was pretty clear."

"That's the part that makes me angriest," Ms. Santos admits, a flash of genuine fury breaking through her professional demeanor. "Using a parent's livelihood as leverage against a student's academic freedom is unconscionable."

"My mom seemed ready to risk it," I say, pride and worry warring in my chest. "But I don't want her to lose her job because of my documentary."

Jordan places a hand on my shoulder, steady and reassuring. "The best protection is publicity. The more people who see the documentary, who understand what happened, the harder it will be for the Liangs to retaliate without looking exactly like the bullies we're exposing."

"He's right," Ms. Santos agrees. "Sunshine is the best disinfectant. We just need to ensure that light reaches enough people before they can shut it down."

The bell signaling the end of lunch period rings, but none of us move. This conversation feels too important to interrupt for class schedules.

"So we proceed," I say, looking around at the determined faces of my team. "We finish the documentary. We prepare for the Debuggers' 'educational discussion' on Friday. And we have contingency plans for when—not if—Avery and the administration try to stop us."

"All while continuing to actually finish the documentary," Trent reminds us wryly. "Which, may I point out, still needs at least twenty hours of editing work."

The scale of what we're attempting—completing a complex documentary while simultaneously outmaneuvering attempts to silence it—settles over us. It's daunting, nearly impossible given our limited time and resources.

But then I think of Maya, still at that remote cabin, still unable to face returning to a world that turned her pain into entertainment. I think of Avery, leveraging this very crisis into a brand-building opportunity with her Digital Wellness Initiative. I think of the platforms that enabled it all, the algorithms that amplified cruelty, the institutions that protected power over truth.

"We can do this," I say, my voice stronger than I feel. "We have to."

Around the table, heads nod in agreement. Ms. Santos smiles, a fierce, proud expression that bolsters my confidence.

"Then let's get to work," she says simply.

As we gather our things, preparing to split up for afternoon classes, Jordan pulls me aside.

"You know Avery's not going to stop at fake social media posts and stealing our venue, right?" he says quietly. "This is just the beginning. It's going to get worse."

I nod, the reality of what we're up against settling into my bones. "I know. But neither are we."

"Together, then," he says, offering his hand.

I take it, feeling the warmth of his palm against mine, the strength in his fingers as they intertwine with my own. "Together."

Outside the News Lab, the hallways buzz with the ordinary chaos of high school life—students rushing to class, laughing at jokes, scrolling through their phones. None of them aware of the battle being waged beneath the surface, the silent war over whose story gets told, whose voice gets heard, whose truth matters.

But they will be. In three days, if we succeed, they'll all know. And that knowledge, that unavoidable confrontation with reality, might be the most powerful signal of all.

# Chapter 19

# CHAPTER 19

Friday arrives with a sense of inevitability, like a wave that's been building for weeks, now finally crashing to shore. 

The lecture hall looks different today. The Debuggers have transformed the space, rearranging chairs in a semi-circle facing the projection screen, setting up additional speakers for better sound quality, even adding makeshift curtains over the windows to control the lighting. It no longer resembles a classroom but a proper screening venue—intimate, focused, purposeful.

"How many confirmed?" I ask Jordan, who's monitoring the online RSVP system we hastily created two days ago.

"Sixty-three," he reports, scrolling through his phone. "Plus the Debuggers, Ms. Santos, your mom, and whoever shows up without registering."

I nod, mentally calculating the lecture hall's capacity. Eighty seats, plus standing room if necessary. We might actually fill the space.

"Any word from the Restrepos?" 

Jordan's expression softens. "They're not coming. Mrs. Restrepo called Ms. Santos this morning. She said they support what we're doing, but it would be too painful to watch."

I swallow against the sudden tightness in my throat. "And Maya?"

"Still at the cabin. She knows about the screening, though. Her dad told her."

I try to imagine Maya's reaction, alone in that remote place, learning that her story—her pain—will be shared with our community tonight. Did she object? Approve? Feel anything at all through the protective numbness she's wrapped around herself?

"Last equipment check," Trent calls from the tech booth at the back of the room. "Sound levels good. Backup generator on standby in case of mysterious power outages. Three separate copies of the documentary ready to go."

We've prepared for every contingency we can imagine. The documentary exists on multiple drives, in encrypted cloud storage, and on physical media distributed among the team. If one version is compromised, we have backups. If the school internet fails, we have hotspots. If the lecture hall becomes suddenly "unavailable," we have three alternative locations on standby, including the public library meeting room and the back patio of a sympathetic coffee shop owner.

"Any sign of interference?" I ask Lia, who's been monitoring the school's administrative communications through channels I've decided not to ask about.

"Nothing direct," she reports, looking up from her laptop. "But there's been a lot of activity in Principal Davis's office this morning. Multiple calls to and from the Liangs. And get this—Avery's Digital Wellness event has suddenly expanded to include 'refreshments and door prizes' for attendees."

"Trying to draw people away from our screening," Jordan observes. "Classic counter-programming."

I should be worried, but instead, I feel an odd sense of validation. These increasingly desperate attempts to silence us, to distract from our message, only prove how much it matters. You don't expend this much effort to suppress something insignificant.

The door opens, and Ms. Santos enters, her expression tense but determined. "Casey, a word?"

We step into the hallway, where she lowers her voice despite the empty corridor. "I've just come from a meeting with Principal Davis. The Liangs are escalating. They're threatening legal action against the school if we proceed—claiming defamation, harassment, creating a hostile environment for their daughter."

"But we have evidence for everything in the documentary," I protest. "We're not making anything up."

"I know that, and you know that. But they're counting on the threat being enough to shut us down, regardless of the merits." She runs a hand through her hair, a rare gesture of frustration from my usually composed mentor. "Davis is scared. The board is pressuring him. He's strongly 'suggesting' we postpone until the school's lawyers can review the content."

"That's just another way of saying no," I say, anger flaring hot in my chest. "A delay tactic."

"Exactly." Ms. Santos glances back toward the lecture hall, where the team continues preparations, unaware of this latest obstacle. "He hasn't officially forbidden the event—he knows that would raise free speech concerns. But he's made it clear there will be 'consequences' if we go forward."

"For you," I realize, the implications sinking in. "Your job."

She shrugs, a small, defiant gesture. "Perhaps. But some things are worth standing up for, Casey. I've been teaching that for years. What kind of teacher would I be if I didn't live by it?"

Her willingness to risk her career—for the documentary, for truth, for the principle of it all—humbles me. First my mother, now Ms. Santos. The adults in my life showing more courage than I could have imagined, reminding me what really matters.

"What do we do?" I ask, though I already know her answer.

"We proceed," she says simply. "With open eyes, prepared for resistance, but unwavering in purpose. The screening starts at 4:30. I'll be there, front row."

She squeezes my shoulder and walks away, her posture straight, her steps steady. Watching her, I feel something shift inside me—fear giving way to resolve, doubt to certainty. This is right. This is necessary. This matters.

I return to the lecture hall, where Jordan immediately senses the change in my demeanor. "What happened?"

"More threats from the Liangs. More pressure on the administration." I look around at our team, these people who have worked tirelessly for two weeks to bring the truth to light. "It's happening. We're going forward. But everyone should know—there might be consequences. Real ones."

Simon looks up from where he's adjusting the projector. "We know."

"We've always known," Sara adds, their twin-speak in perfect sync as usual.

Trent nods from the tech booth. "Worth it."

"The system doesn't change unless someone challenges it," Lia says, closing her laptop with finality. "That's us. Today."

Their immediate, unwavering support brings a lump to my throat. These people—some of whom I barely knew two weeks ago—standing firm beside me, risking academic consequences, taking on power structures much larger than themselves, all for the sake of truth.

"Okay then," I say, my voice steadier than I feel. "Let's finish setting up. Doors open in two hours."

---

At 4:15, I stand behind the curtain we've rigged at the back of the lecture hall, heart hammering against my ribs. Through a small gap, I can see people filing in—students, teachers, parents, community members. More than I expected. More than we planned for.

"We're past capacity," Jordan whispers, appearing beside me. "Had to bring in extra chairs from classrooms. Standing room only now."

"How many?"

"At least a hundred. Word spread fast once Avery's people started trying to counter-program." He smiles wryly. "Nothing makes something more attractive than someone powerful trying to shut it down."

The room buzzes with anticipation, a current of nervous energy running through the crowd. I spot familiar faces—students from my classes, teachers I respect, parents I recognize from school functions. And there, in the front row as promised, Ms. Santos sits beside my mother, both of them radiating quiet support.

My phone vibrates in my pocket—a text from Dex, the first contact since I walked out of The Node days ago:

**Dex:** Saw the event notice. Gutsy move. I still think my way would have been more effective, but respect for seeing this through. Let me know if you need digital backup. I'm watching.

The message surprises me—not threatening or vindictive, but almost... supportive? In his way. I don't respond, but I feel a small weight lift from my shoulders. One less enemy to worry about tonight.

"Five minutes," Trent calls softly from behind me. "Documentary loaded and ready. Sound check complete."

I nod, unable to speak past the tightness in my throat. This is it. After weeks of work, of fighting, of navigating obstacles, we're about to share Maya's story—and the broader truth it illuminates—with our community.

"I'm scared," I admit to Jordan, the words barely audible.

"I know." He takes my hand, his palm warm against mine. "But you're not alone. Look at all these people who came to listen. Who want to understand."

"What if it doesn't change anything?" The fear that's been lurking beneath all our work finally surfaces. "What if they see it and still don't care? If the system is too big, too entrenched to be affected by one documentary?"

"Then at least we told the truth," Jordan says simply. "At least we tried. That matters, Casey. That's always mattered."

Before I can respond, there's a commotion at the lecture hall entrance. Through the curtain gap, I see Principal Davis entering, his expression grave. Behind him, Avery Liang and her parents, their faces masks of controlled anger.

"Incoming," I whisper to Jordan, nodding toward the disturbance.

He tenses beside me. "Should we delay? Regroup?"

"No." The word comes out firm, decisive. "We proceed. Now."

Jordan squeezes my hand once more, then slips away to signal Trent. I watch as Principal Davis scans the room, clearly surprised by the size of the crowd. He speaks briefly to Ms. Santos, who responds with calm determination, gesturing to the already-seated audience. Whatever he had planned—shutting down the event, removing us from the room—becomes more complicated with so many witnesses.

The lights dim, and a hush falls over the crowd. Avery and her parents remain standing at the back, unwilling to take seats but unable to stop what's happening without creating a scene.

On the screen, the documentary begins.

*THE SIGNAL*
*A Documentary by Casey Morales*

The title appears in simple white text against a black background, then fades to Maya's face—unfiltered, authentic, speaking directly to the camera during that first interview, before everything went wrong.

"I stopped posting my art online because the responses hurt too much," she says, her voice clear in the silent room. "Not the negative ones—those I could handle. It was seeing something vulnerable, something that mattered to me, treated like just another piece of content to scroll past. To consume and forget."

The documentary unfolds exactly as we planned—starting with Maya's story, then widening to show how her experience connects to broader patterns of digital inequality, platform incentives that reward spectacle over substance, and institutional failures to protect vulnerable voices.

When the footage of Avery's theft appears—the screenshots, the server logs, the timestamps proving the sequence of events—I hear a murmur ripple through the audience. When Maya's livestream breakdown plays, followed by the cascade of memes, remixes, and monetized cruelty it spawned, the murmur becomes a palpable tension, a collective holding of breath.

I can't see Avery's face from my position, but I can imagine her reaction as her own words appear on screen—the private messages planning the "perfect trap" of the livestream, her celebration of Maya's breakdown as "engagement gold," her strategic positioning as a mental health advocate in its aftermath.

The documentary doesn't vilify her—we were careful about that. It simply shows what happened, what choices were made, what consequences followed. It places her actions within the context of a system designed to reward exactly this kind of behavior, to prioritize engagement over ethics, spectacle over substance.

As the final segment plays—experts discussing how algorithms amplify certain voices while silencing others, how platforms profit from conflict, how institutions protect reputation over justice—I feel a shift in the room. Not just attention, but understanding. Recognition. A collective drawing of connections between Maya's individual experience and the larger forces that shaped it.

The screen fades to black, and for a moment, complete silence fills the lecture hall. No movement, no whispers, no shuffling of feet. Just the weight of truth, finally told in full.

Then, slowly, applause begins. Scattered at first, then building until it fills the space—not celebratory, but somber, acknowledging. The sound of people responding to something that has moved them, challenged them, perhaps changed them.

As the applause continues, I step out from behind the curtain. This is the moment I've been dreading and preparing for—facing the community directly, not hiding behind my camera or my footage, but standing in the light, speaking in my own voice.

The applause quiets as I move to the front of the room, all eyes turning to me. I see Principal Davis at the back, his expression unreadable. Avery and her parents remain, their faces tight with controlled fury. My mom and Ms. Santos in the front row, their pride palpable even through my fear.

"Thank you for coming," I begin, my voice shakier than I'd like. "For witnessing not just Maya's story, but a story about all of us—about the digital world we've built and the real-world consequences it creates."

I take a deep breath, steadying myself. "This documentary isn't about blame. It's about systems—systems that determine whose voices matter, that reward certain types of engagement regardless of harm, that protect the powerful while exposing the vulnerable."

As I speak, something strange happens. My fear recedes, replaced by a clarity I haven't felt in weeks. The words flow not from anger or revenge, but from the truth I've been working to understand since this all began.

"What happened to Maya wasn't an accident or an isolated incident. It was the predictable outcome of platforms designed to amplify the loudest voices, not the most valuable ones. Of algorithms that treat human pain as just another form of engaging content. Of institutions that prioritize reputation over accountability."

I look directly at Avery for the first time, meeting her gaze across the crowded room. "And yes, of individual choices to use those systems for personal gain, regardless of who gets hurt in the process."

Avery stares back, her expression a complex mix of defiance and something else—discomfort, perhaps. The beginnings of shame. For the first time, she can't control the narrative, can't curate the image others see. She stands exposed not as a villain in a simple story, but as a participant in a broken system, making choices that system rewarded.

"I'm not asking you to cancel anyone or to participate in another round of online outrage," I continue, turning back to the wider audience. "That would just feed the same system that created this problem. Instead, I'm asking you to think about your own participation in these platforms. About what you amplify with your attention, your clicks, your shares."

The room is utterly silent, every face turned toward me, every person seemingly holding their breath.

"Maya is still gone," I say, my voice catching slightly. "Still hiding from a world that turned her pain into entertainment. That's the real cost of the system we've built—not just damaged reputations or lost opportunities, but human beings who disappear because existing online becomes too painful."

I see tears on some faces now, nods of recognition, the uncomfortable shifting of those confronting their own role in what happened.

"This documentary isn't the end of the conversation. It's the beginning. A signal through the noise, asking us to consider what we value, what we amplify, what we're willing to sacrifice for engagement."

As I finish speaking, the silence in the room feels different—charged with understanding, with the weight of collective responsibility. Then, from the back, a single person begins to clap. Others join, the sound building again, but different now—not just acknowledging what they've seen, but committing to something more.

Principal Davis remains still, his expression troubled but thoughtful. The Liangs have disappeared, slipping out during my speech, but Avery remains, standing alone at the back of the room. For a brief moment, our eyes meet again across the crowd, and I see something I never expected—recognition. Not agreement or apology, but an acknowledgment that the game has changed, that her carefully constructed narrative no longer stands unchallenged.

Then she too is gone, pushing through the exit doors as the applause continues around her.

People begin to stand, forming small groups, discussing what they've seen. The energy in the room has transformed—from passive audience to engaged community, wrestling with difficult truths. Ms. Santos and my mom make their way toward me, pride evident in their faces.

"You did it," Mom says simply, pulling me into a tight hug. "You made them see."

"We did it," I correct, looking past her to where Jordan, Trent, Lia, and the Kim twins are emerging from their positions around the room. "All of us together."

Ms. Santos joins us, her expression solemn but satisfied. "This is just the beginning, you know. The pushback will be fierce. The system doesn't change without resistance."

"I know," I acknowledge, the weight of that reality settling alongside the triumph of the moment. "But we've started something. Created a space for truth that wasn't there before."

As we stand together, people approach—students wanting to share their own experiences, parents expressing concerns about platform safety, teachers asking how to incorporate these issues into their curriculum. The screening has transformed from an event into a conversation, exactly as we hoped.

In the midst of it all, my phone buzzes with a text. I glance down, expecting more feedback from attendees who found the RSVP link.

Instead, it's a message from Mrs. Restrepo:

**Mrs. Restrepo:** Maya watched the livestream. From the cabin. She says to tell you "thank you for the signal." She's coming home tomorrow.

The simple message brings tears to my eyes—not just relief that Maya is finally returning, but the knowledge that our work reached her, that she understood what we were trying to do. That somewhere in her pain, she recognized the truth we were fighting to tell.

Jordan appears at my side, having extracted himself from a conversation with a group of students. "You okay?"

I show him the text, unable to speak past the emotion tightening my throat.

He reads it, his expression softening. "She saw it. She's coming back."

"It's not fixed," I say, finding my voice. "The damage is still there. The system is still broken. But—"

"But she's not alone anymore," Jordan finishes. "None of us are." He looks around at the continuing conversations filling the lecture hall, the community engaging with difficult truths instead of scrolling past them. "That's what matters, isn't it? Finding each other through the noise."

"Yes," I agree, feeling something settle inside me—not the fierce triumph I expected, but a quieter certainty. A purpose that extends beyond this moment, this documentary, this particular fight. "That's what matters."

The lecture hall buzzes with conversation, with connection, with the messy, imperfect process of people grappling with truth together. It's not a neat ending—Avery hasn't been dramatically toppled, the platforms haven't changed overnight, justice hasn't been fully served.

But a signal has been sent. A truth has been told. A community has begun to listen.

And Maya is coming home.

For tonight, that's enough. For tonight, that's everything.

# CHAPTER 20

The morning after the screening, I wake to an unfamiliar sensation: sunlight streaming through my bedroom window. For the past two weeks, I've been up before dawn, working on the documentary, strategizing with the Debuggers, fighting to be heard. Today, I slept past nine.

My phone is filled with notifications—social media mentions, text messages, emails. News of the screening has spread beyond North Point High, picked up by local blogs and even a regional news site that covers tech issues. "Student Documentary Challenges Platform Accountability," reads one headline. Another: "North Point High Confronts Digital Ethics in Student-Led Project."

I scroll through it all with a strange detachment, as if watching someone else's story unfold. There's something surreal about seeing the work we've done—the private, painful truth we've been fighting to tell—transformed into public discourse, into headlines and comment sections and social media debates.

A text from Jordan sits at the top of my notifications:

**Jordan:** Principal Davis called an emergency faculty meeting for 10 AM. Ms. Santos will update us after. How are you feeling?

The simple question breaks through my detachment. How *am* I feeling? Exhausted, certainly. Relieved that the screening happened despite all attempts to stop it. Anxious about what comes next. But beneath those immediate reactions is something else—a quiet certainty, a sense of purpose that wasn't there before.

**Me:** Tired. Overwhelmed. But okay, I think. You?

His response comes immediately:

**Jordan:** Same. Plus my parents have suddenly decided I'm some kind of digital rights activist and keep asking me to explain algorithms to their friends.

I laugh out loud, the sound strange in my quiet bedroom. It feels good—normal, human, a reminder that life continues beyond crisis.

**Me:** The burden of expertise. Should we meet up later? Process everything?

**Jordan:** Definitely. Beach? 4 PM?

**Me:** See you there.

I set my phone down and stretch, muscles aching from weeks of tension. My room looks different somehow—the posters on the walls, the camera equipment on my desk, the half-finished projects scattered around. Or maybe I'm the one who's different, seeing with new eyes.

Mom's voice calls from the kitchen, "Casey? You up? I made breakfast!"

In the kitchen, I find her at the stove, flipping pancakes. She's wearing her Solas uniform but hasn't left for work yet.

"Morning," I say, sliding onto a stool at the counter. "Aren't you late for your shift?"

"Day off," she replies, sliding a plate of pancakes toward me. "I called in. Thought we could use some time together after everything."

The simple gesture—pancakes on a Saturday morning, time carved out just for us—brings a lump to my throat. "Thanks, Mom."

We eat in comfortable silence for a few minutes, the events of the last weeks settling around us like dust after an earthquake. Finally, Mom sets down her fork and looks at me directly.

"I'm proud of you," she says simply. "Not just for finishing the documentary or standing up to the Liangs. For making the hard choice to tell the truth in a way that builds rather than destroys."

Her words touch something deep inside me—the lingering doubt about the path I chose, the nagging question of whether Dex's more destructive approach might have been more effective.

"Do you think it will matter?" I ask, voicing the fear that's been sitting beneath everything else. "The documentary, I mean. Will it actually change anything?"

Mom considers the question, her expression thoughtful. "I think it already has." She gestures toward my phone, still lighting up with notifications. "Look at the conversations happening now. People who never thought about these issues are suddenly discussing algorithmic bias and platform responsibility. That's change, Casey."

"But Avery—" I start.

"May or may not face direct consequences," Mom finishes for me. "That was never really the point, was it? Your documentary wasn't about punishing one person. It was about exposing a system that rewards the wrong things."

She's right, of course. Somewhere along the way, between the initial theft and the final screening, my purpose shifted from seeking justice against Avery to illuminating the broader patterns her actions exemplified.

"Maya's coming home today," I say, changing the subject. "Mrs. Restrepo texted last night."

Mom's expression softens. "That's good news. How do you feel about seeing her?"

"Nervous," I admit. "I don't know if she'll forgive me. For involving her in the documentary originally. For everything that happened after."

"All you can do is be there," Mom says gently. "Listen to what she needs. Remember that healing isn't linear."

Before I can respond, my phone rings—Ms. Santos.

"I should take this," I say, reaching for the device.

Mom nods, gathering our plates. "I'll be here."

I answer the call, moving toward my room for privacy. "Ms. Santos? How was the meeting?"

"Interesting," she replies, her voice measured. "Principal Davis is initiating a formal review of the school's social media policies and cyberbullying response protocols. And there's going to be an investigation into the events surrounding Maya's harassment."

"An investigation?" I repeat, surprised. "Into Avery?"

"Not just Avery. The entire situation—how the school responded, what platforms were used, who was involved." She pauses. "It's not the dramatic justice you might have hoped for, but it's a start. The administration is at least acknowledging there's a problem."

I absorb this information, trying to gauge my own reaction. It's not a tidy resolution—no public apology from Avery, no dramatic expulsion, no immediate consequences for those responsible. But it's something. A crack in the system. A sign that institutional silence isn't absolute.

"What about you?" I ask, remembering the threats to her job. "Are you in trouble?"

Ms. Santos laughs, a short, surprised sound. "Quite the opposite, actually. The regional education board has asked me to develop a digital ethics curriculum based on the issues raised in your documentary. Apparently, several board members have teenage children who attended the screening and came home with questions."

Relief and pride wash over me. "That's amazing."

"It's a small step," she cautions. "But meaningful change often begins that way—not with grand revolutions, but with enough small steps in the right direction."

After we hang up, I sit on the edge of my bed, processing everything. The investigation, the curriculum project, Maya's return—none of these are the clean, satisfying resolutions I might have imagined weeks ago. They're complicated, incremental, imperfect. But they're real.

My phone buzzes with another notification. A social media alert—Avery has posted for the first time since the screening. Despite myself, I tap on it.

The post is just a simple text image on a plain background. No carefully curated photo, no strategic lighting or perfect pose.

*Taking some time away from social platforms to reflect on my role in our digital community. I'm listening and learning. – AL*

The comments are a mix of support from her loyal followers and critical questions from those who attended the screening. Avery hasn't responded to any of them. The post has far fewer likes than her usual content.

It's not an apology. It's not an admission of guilt. But it's a retreat—a step back from the carefully constructed persona she's maintained for years. A crack in the façade.

I close the app, feeling neither triumph nor disappointment. Just a quiet acknowledgment that something has shifted, not just for Avery but for everyone touched by this story.

---

At three-thirty, I head toward the beach to meet Jordan, walking the familiar path down from the hillside neighborhood to the shore. The day is cool but bright, the bay sparkling under late afternoon sun. The world continues its ordinary rotation, indifferent to the dramas that consume us.

I reach our meeting spot—a quiet stretch of shore past the main beach, marked by a weather-worn bench facing the water—early, giving me time to gather my thoughts. The past twenty-four hours have been a whirlwind of reactions, responses, and revelations. I need to process it all, to understand what it means for what comes next.

"Thought I'd find you here early."

I turn to see Jordan approaching, hands in his pockets, the breeze ruffling his dark hair. He looks tired but peaceful, the tension of the past weeks softened around his eyes.

"Predictable, am I?" I ask as he sits beside me on the bench.

"Thoughtful," he corrects. "You like to have time to form your own opinions before hearing everyone else's."

The simple observation—so accurate, so specific to me—brings a smile to my face. "Have you been studying me, Jordan Seo?"

"Observing," he says with a small shrug. "It's what we both do, isn't it? Watch closely. Notice what others miss."

We sit in comfortable silence for a moment, watching the waves lap at the shore. Seagulls wheel overhead, their cries carried on the wind.

"Ms. Santos told me about the investigation," Jordan says finally. "And Avery's post."

"Small steps," I reply, echoing Ms. Santos's earlier words.

"Important ones." He turns to look at me directly. "You know what Dex would have done—the scorched earth approach—might have felt more satisfying in the moment. But it wouldn't have created this kind of change."

"You think this is real change?" I ask, genuinely curious about his perspective.

Jordan considers the question, his gaze thoughtful. "I think it's the beginning of change. When institutions start investigating themselves, when people in power acknowledge problems, when communities engage with difficult truths—that's where real change starts. Not with dramatic takedowns, but with shifts in collective understanding."

His words resonate with something I've been feeling but couldn't articulate. The documentary's impact isn't measured in Avery's personal downfall or platform policy changes announced the next day. It's in the conversations happening in living rooms and classrooms, in the questions being asked by people who never questioned before, in the cracks appearing in systems designed to resist scrutiny.

"The Debuggers are talking about making this an ongoing project," Jordan continues. "Not just a one-time documentary, but a sustained effort to monitor platform accountability, document algorithmic bias, create resources for people who experience digital harassment."

"That sounds important," I say, a familiar spark of purpose flickering to life. "Count me in."

Jordan smiles, the expression lighting his entire face. "I was hoping you'd say that." He hesitates, then adds more softly, "We're good together, you know. As a team."

The subtext in his words—the suggestion of something more than just collaboration—brings warmth to my cheeks. Before I can respond, my phone rings. Mrs. Restrepo.

"I should take this," I say, my heart suddenly racing. "It's about Maya."

Jordan nods, giving me space as I answer the call.

"Hello?"

"Casey." Mrs. Restrepo's voice sounds tired but no longer hollowed by despair. "Maya's home. She's asking to see you."

The simple statement sends a jolt through me—relief, anxiety, hope all tangled together. "Now?"

"If you can," she confirms. "She's... it's still difficult. But she wants to talk to you."

"I'll be right there," I promise, already standing.

After ending the call, I turn to Jordan, emotions warring on my face. "Maya's back. She wants to see me."

He stands immediately. "Go. We'll talk later."

"Are you sure? We were supposed to—"

"This is more important," he says firmly. "Maya needs you. The rest can wait."

The generosity of his understanding, his immediate prioritization of Maya's needs over our conversation, only confirms what I've been feeling about him these past weeks.

"Thank you," I say, meaning it deeply. "For everything. For being there through all of this."

"Always," he replies simply.

The word hangs between us, a promise larger than the moment. Before I can overthink it, I step forward and kiss his cheek—a quick, impulsive gesture that surprises us both.

"I'll call you later," I say, already backing away.

His smile follows me as I turn and hurry up the beach path, toward Maya's house, toward whatever comes next.

---

The Restrepo house feels different—quieter, more subdued than the frantic energy that filled it during Maya's disappearance. Mrs. Restrepo answers the door with a tired smile.

"She's in her room," she says quietly. "We're taking it day by day. Hour by hour, really."

"Thank you for letting me see her," I reply, acutely aware of how easily they could have shut me out completely, blamed me for everything that happened.

"The documentary," Mrs. Restrepo says, stopping me before I head upstairs. "It was... important. Painful to think about, but important."

I nod, unsure what to say. The Restrepos' approval wasn't the goal, but it matters—an acknowledgment that our work honored rather than exploited Maya's story.

"She watched it twice," Mrs. Restrepo adds. "At the cabin. I think it helped her understand that what happened wasn't... isolated. That it wasn't just about her."

"That's what we hoped," I say softly. "To show the pattern, not just the personal pain."

She squeezes my arm gently, then gestures toward the stairs. "Go on up. She's waiting."

I climb the familiar staircase, each step both routine and momentous. How many times have I walked this path to Maya's room? Hundreds, maybe thousands over the years of our friendship. But never like this—never with this weight between us, this uncertainty.

I knock softly on her door.

"Come in."

Maya's voice—so familiar, yet somehow changed. I push the door open slowly.

The room is different from when I last saw it. No longer barren and stripped of personality, but not returned to its former creative chaos either. There are a few art supplies on the desk, a single poster on the wall, books stacked neatly on the shelves. A space in transition, like Maya herself.

She sits cross-legged on her bed, wearing an oversized sweatshirt and leggings. Her hair is pulled back in a simple ponytail, her face makeup-free and pale. She looks both younger and older than her seventeen years—vulnerable yet somehow weathered.

"Hi," I say, the simplest greeting feeling inadequate for the moment.

"Hi," she echoes, gesturing for me to sit in the desk chair across from her.

I take the offered seat, unsure how to begin. What do you say to someone who's been through what Maya has? What words could possibly bridge the chasm of her pain, my guilt, everything that's happened?

"I watched your documentary," she says finally, breaking the silence. "Both livestream and the recorded version."

"What did you think?" I ask, genuinely unsure of her reaction.

"It was good," she says simply. "True. Not just about what happened to me, but about why it happened. How the system is designed to create situations like this."

Relief washes over me. She understands what we were trying to do—not exploit her story, but contextualize it, use it to illuminate larger patterns.

"I wasn't sure if you'd approve," I admit. "We tried to be careful with how we presented your experience. To respect your privacy while still telling the truth."

"You did." She picks at a loose thread on her sweatshirt sleeve, eyes downcast. "It was hard to watch. But important. I needed to understand that it wasn't just... me. My weakness. My failure to handle it."

"Maya, no." The words burst out before I can stop them. "None of this was your fault or your failure. The system is designed to amplify cruelty, to turn pain into content. No one should have to 'handle' what happened to you."

She looks up, a ghost of a smile touching her lips. "That's almost exactly what the therapist at the crisis center told me yesterday."

"Smart therapist," I say, relief warming my voice.

"I'm not okay," Maya continues, her tone matter-of-fact rather than emotional. "I probably won't be for a while. What happened—the livestream, the memes, all of it—it changed something in me. Broke something, maybe. I don't know if it can be fixed."

The simple honesty of her assessment brings tears to my eyes. "I'm so sorry, Maya. For all of it. For involving you in the documentary in the first place. For not protecting you better."

She shakes her head slowly. "You didn't cause this, Casey. Avery did. The platforms did. The people who shared and laughed and turned it into entertainment did." She pauses, considering. "Maybe I even did, a little, by agreeing to the interview, by thinking I could step into that world without getting hurt."

"That's not fair," I argue. "You should be able to share your art, your voice, without fearing this kind of response."

"Should be," she agrees with a sad smile. "But that's not the world we live in. Not yet, anyway."

We sit in silence for a moment, the weight of that truth settling between us. The gap between the world that should be and the world that is—the space our documentary tried to illuminate.

"I started drawing again," Maya says after a while, nodding toward her desk where a sketchbook lies open. "At the cabin. Just for myself, not to share. It helps... process everything."

"Can I see?" I ask, careful not to presume.

She nods, and I move to the desk, looking down at the open page. The sketch is powerful—a figure curled protectively around something glowing, surrounded by grasping hands and open mouths. Despite the dark imagery, there's something hopeful in the light the figure protects, something resilient.

"It's beautiful," I say honestly. "And painful."

"Both can be true," she replies. "That's what I'm learning. Something can hurt terribly and still have value. Still be worth creating."

Her words strike deep, resonating with everything we've been through these past weeks. The documentary was painful to make, painful to share, painful to witness. But necessary. Valuable. Worth the cost.

"What happens now?" I ask, returning to the chair. "With school, with everything?"

Maya sighs, a small sound that carries the weight of difficult decisions. "I'm finishing the year online. Can't face going back to North Point yet. Maybe in the fall, maybe not. We're looking at other options."

I nod, understanding completely. The halls of North Point would be filled with reminders, with people who participated in her humiliation, with the ghosts of what happened.

"And you?" she asks. "The documentary is done. What's next for Casey Morales, filmmaker?"

The question catches me off guard. I've been so focused on finishing the documentary, on getting the truth out, that I've barely thought about what comes after.

"I'm not sure," I admit. "Jordan mentioned the Debuggers are thinking about making this an ongoing project—monitoring platform accountability, documenting algorithmic bias, creating resources for people who experience harassment."

"That sounds like you," Maya says, and I hear genuine warmth in her voice for the first time. "Fighting the good fight. Shining light on invisible barriers."

"What about us?" I ask, the question that's been lurking beneath everything else finally surfacing. "Our friendship. Can we..."

I trail off, unable to find the right words. Can we go back? Can we move forward? Can we find a new normal after everything that's happened?

Maya looks at me directly, her eyes tired but clear. "I don't know, Casey. I think we need to... find new ground. I'm not the same person I was before all this. You aren't either."

The honesty hurts, but I appreciate it more than false reassurance would have. "I understand."

"But," she continues, "I'd like to try. Not to go back—we can't go back. But to figure out who we are to each other now. After everything."

It's not the immediate reconciliation part of me hoped for, but it's real. Authentic. True to where we both are.

"I'd like that too," I say softly.

We talk a while longer—about her time at the cabin, about the documentary's reception, about the small, careful steps she's taking toward healing. The conversation is different from our easy exchanges before all this began—more measured, more mindful, sometimes painfully honest. But real. Present. Not defined solely by what happened, but not ignoring it either.

When I finally leave, the sun is setting over Meridian Bay, casting long shadows across the streets. I walk slowly, processing everything—the investigation at school, Avery's retreat from social media, Maya's careful steps toward recovery, Jordan waiting for my call.

Nothing is resolved, not really. The platforms that enabled Maya's harassment still exist, still operate on the same engagement-driven models. Avery may be temporarily humbled, but the system that rewarded her behavior remains largely intact. Maya's pain hasn't disappeared; her healing will be long and nonlinear.

But something has changed. A conversation has begun. Questions are being asked that weren't being asked before. Small cracks have appeared in systems designed to resist scrutiny.

And I've changed too. The Casey who started this journey—hiding behind her camera, observing but not participating, documenting but not acting—has been transformed. I found my voice. My purpose. My courage to stand in the light and speak truth, even when it's frightening, even when the cost is high.

I reach the clifftop overlook as the last light fades from the sky. Below, the bay stretches dark and vast, signal lights blinking on boats navigating the waters. Red, green, white—small points of information cutting through the darkness, guiding those who know how to read them.

Pulling out my phone, I call Jordan.

"How was it?" he asks immediately. "How's Maya?"

"It was... complicated," I say honestly. "She's not okay, but she's working toward it. We both are."

"That's all anyone can do," he says, his voice warm with understanding. "Work toward okay, one step at a time."

"Can you meet me?" I ask suddenly. "At the overlook by Lighthouse Point?"

"On my way," he says without hesitation. "Ten minutes."

While I wait, I watch the signal lights on the water, thinking about what they represent—communication through darkness, guidance through complexity, connection despite distance. Exactly what we tried to create with the documentary. A signal cutting through noise. A truth that needed telling.

I hear footsteps approaching and turn to see Jordan walking toward me, his face softened in the glow of the nearby streetlight.

"Hey," he says simply, coming to stand beside me at the railing.

"Hey."

We look out at the bay together, the comfortable silence between us worth more than words. After everything—the frantic work, the fighting to be heard, the screening itself—this quiet moment feels like a gift.

"Thank you," I say finally, "for believing in the documentary. For helping make it happen. For standing with me through all of this."

"Thank you for having the courage to tell the truth," he replies. "For choosing the harder path when it would have been easier to give in to anger."

His hand rests on the railing beside mine, our fingers nearly touching. Slowly, deliberately, I move my hand until our fingers intertwine, the simple connection grounding me in the present moment.

"What happens now?" Jordan asks softly.

"I don't know," I admit. "The documentary is done, but the work isn't. The system's still broken. Maya's still healing. Nothing's really fixed."

"But something's started," he says, giving my hand a gentle squeeze. "A signal's been sent. People are listening who weren't listening before."

"Yes," I agree, feeling the truth of it settle in my bones. "A signal's been sent."

We stand together at the railing, watching the lights on the water, the stars emerging above, the vast, complex world continuing its turn. The grief for Maya—for what she lost, for what we all lost in this process—remains a steady ache. But alongside it now is something else: a quiet hope, a sense of purpose, a commitment to the work that lies ahead.

Not an ending, but a beginning. Not a resolution, but a shift. Not a single victory, but the first step in a longer journey.

A signal through the noise. A voice that wasn't there before. A truth that needed telling, finally told.

For now, that's enough. For now, that's everything.
